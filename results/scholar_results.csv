COMA addresses three challenges related to the obfuscated circuits: First, it removes the need for the storage of the obfuscation unlock key at the untrusted chip. Second, it implements a mechanism by which the key sent for unlocking an obfuscated circuit changes after each activation (even for the same device), transforming the key into a dynamically changing license. Third, it protects the communication to/from the COMA protected device and additionally introduces two novel mechanisms for the exchange of data to/from COMA protected architectures: (1) a highly secure but slow double encryption, which is used for exchange of key and sensitive data (2) a high-performance and low-energy yet leaky encryption, secured by means of frequent key renewal. We demonstrate that compared to state-of-the-art key management architectures, COMA reduces the area overhead by 14%, while allowing additional features including unique chip authentication, enabling activation as a service (for IoT devices), reducing the side channel attack on key management architecture, and providing two new means of the secure communication to/from an COMA-secured untrusted chip.",40,https://www.usenix.org/conference/raid2019/presentation/azar,"""supply chain"" source:""Attacks, Intrusions and Defenses""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Uptane is gaining traction in the automobile industry and is widely considered the next de-facto standard for OTA automobile software updates. The security of Uptane is of utmost importance because modern automobiles rely on software for their safety-critical functionalities and, especially, require OTA software updates to add new safety features or patch bugs in existing ones. Design flaws in Uptane can either violate the integrity of the updates to be installed or prevent vehicles from installing new updates, both of which can cause severe safety issues. Previous approaches to protocol verification either fail to capture the necessary features of Uptane or suffer from termination issues due to Uptane’s complexity. A key component of our approach lies in the eager combination of an infinite-state model checker and a cryptographic protocol verifier, where (in contrast to prior lazy approaches) we are able to eliminate a key manual step in the workflow while enabling reasoning over more fine-grained message structures. In addition, our approach utilizes two proven soundness- and completeness-preserving state-space-reduction optimizations for computational tractability, as well as a meta-level analysis technique that makes it feasible to reason over Uptane’s set of optional protocol features. Our approach is able to discover six new vulnerabilities while rediscovering all five known ones. While there have been previous analyses of Uptane’s security properties, they either missed design flaws identified by our approach or suffered from coverage and termination issues. The Uptane standards body has positively acknowledged our findings and has suggested updates to the protocol specification documents to address them.",0,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3678890.3678927,"""supply chain"" source:""Attacks, Intrusions and Defenses""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The ever-growing number of actors and the complexity of their campaigns have made it difficult for defenders to track and attribute these malicious activities effectively. Traditionally, researchers relied on threat intelligence to track APTs. However, this often led to fragmented information, delays in connecting campaigns with specific threat groups, and misattribution.In response to these challenges, we introduce ADAPT, a machine learning-based approach for automatically attributing APTs at two levels: (1) the threat campaign level, to identify samples with similar objectives and (2) the threat group level, to identify samples operated by the same entity. ADAPT supports a variety of heterogeneous file types targeting different platforms, including executables and documents, and uses linking features to find connections between them. We evaluate ADAPT on a reference dataset from MITRE as well as a comprehensive, label-standardized dataset of 6,134 APT samples belonging to 92 threat groups.

However, this advancement also enables malicious command and control (C2) traffic to more effectively evade malware detectors and intrusion detection systems. Among other capabilities, TLS 1.3 introduces encryption for most handshake messages and conceals the actual TLS record content type, complicating the task for state-of-the-art C2 traffic classifiers that were initially developed for TLS 1.2 traffic. Given the pressing need to accurately detect malicious C2 communications, this paper examines to what extent existing C2 classifiers for TLS 1.2 are less effective when applied to TLS 1.3 traffic, posing a central research question: is it possible to adapt TLS 1.2 detection methodologies for C2 traffic to work with TLS 1.3 flows?We answer this question affirmatively by introducing new methods for inferring certificate size and filtering handshake/protocol-related records in TLS 1.3 flows. These techniques enable the extraction of key features for enhancing traffic detection and can be utilized to pre-process data flows before applying C2 classifiers. We demonstrate that this approach facilitates the use of existing TLS 1.2 C2 classifiers with high efficacy, allowing for the passive classification of encrypted network traffic. In our tests, we inferred certificate sizes with an average error of 1.0%, and achieved detection rates of 100% when classifying traffic based on certificate size, and over 93% when classifying TLS 1.3 traffic behavior after training solely on TLS 1.2 traffic.

One increasingly common evasive method is to hide the malicious activity behind a benign program by using tools that are already installed on user computers. These programs are usually part of the operating system distribution or another user-installed binary, therefore this type of attack is called “Living-Off-The-Land”. Detecting these attacks is challenging, as adversaries may not create malicious files on the victim computers and anti-virus scans fail to detect them.We propose the design of an Active Learning framework called LOLAL for detecting Living-Off-the-Land attacks that iteratively selects a set of uncertain and anomalous samples for labeling by a human analyst. LOLAL is specifically designed to work well when a limited number of labeled samples are available for training machine learning models to detect attacks.

We leverage a large, anonymized dataset collected by an endpoint security product and demonstrate that our ensemble classifiers achieve an average F1 score of 96% at classifying different attack classes.

However, vulnerability of GNNs to successful backdoor attacks was only shown recently.In this paper, we disclose the TRAP attack, a Transferable GRAPh backdoor attack. The core attack principle is to poison the training dataset with perturbation-based triggers that can lead to an effective and transferable backdoor attack. The perturbation trigger for a graph is generated by performing the perturbation actions on the graph structure via a gradient based score matrix from a surrogate model. Compared with prior works, TRAP attack is different in several ways: i) it exploits a surrogate Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) model to generate perturbation triggers for a blackbox based backdoor attack; ii) it generates sample-specific perturbation triggers which do not have a fixed pattern; and iii) the attack transfers, for the first time in the context of GNNs, to different GNN models when trained with the forged poisoned training dataset.

A fundamental challenge of FL is that the clients are often heterogeneous, e.g., they have different computing powers, and thus the clients may send model updates to the server with substantially different delays. Asynchronous FL aims to address this challenge by enabling the server to update the model once any client’s model update reaches it without waiting for other clients’ model updates. However, like synchronous FL, asynchronous FL is also vulnerable to poisoning attacks, in which malicious clients manipulate the model via poisoning their local data and/or model updates sent to the server. Byzantine-robust FL aims to defend against poisoning attacks. In particular, Byzantine-robust FL can learn an accurate model even if some clients are malicious and have Byzantine behaviors. However, most existing studies on Byzantine-robust FL focused on synchronous FL, leaving asynchronous FL largely unexplored. In this work, we bridge this gap by proposing AFLGuard, a Byzantine-robust asynchronous FL method.

These techniques allow for a greater diversity of trust relationships while eliminating the security risk of single points of failure.To evaluate Artemis, we examine attacks on software update systems from the Cloud Native Computing Foundation’s Catalog of Supply Chain Compromises, and find that the most secure configuration of Artemis can prevent all of them, compared to 14-59% for the best existing system.

However, they largely suffer from model quality degradation due to the over-removal of local updates or/and the inefficiency caused by the expensive analysis of the high-dimensional local updates.In this work, we propose AgrAmplifier that aims to simultaneously attain the triad of robustness, fidelity and efficiency for FL. AgrAmplifier features the amplification of the “morality” of local updates to render their maliciousness and benignness clearly distinguishable. It re-organizes the local updates into patches and extracts the most activated features in the patches. This strategy can effectively enhance the robustness of the aggregator, and it also retains high fidelity as the amplified updates become more resistant to local translations. Furthermore, the significant dimension reduction in the feature space greatly benefits the efficiency of the aggregation.AgrAmplifier is compatible with any existing Byzantine-robust mechanism. In this paper, we integrate it with three mainstream ones, i.e., distance-based, prediction-based, and trust bootstrapping-based mechanisms. Our extensive evaluation against five representative poisoning attacks on five datasets across diverse domains demonstrates the consistent enhancement for all of them, with average gains at, and in terms of robustness, fidelity, and efficiency respectively.

Rather than using USB devices solely as a delivery mechanism for host-side exploits, attackers are targeting the USB stack itself, embedding malicious code in device firmware to covertly request additional USB interfaces, providing unacknowledged and malicious functionality that lies outside the apparent purpose of the device. This allows for attacks such as BadUSB, where a USB storage device with malicious firmware is capable of covertly acting as a keyboard as well, allowing it to inject malicious scripts into the host machine. We observe that the root cause of such attacks is that the USB Stack exposes a set of unrestricted device privileges and note that the most reliable information about a device's capabilities comes from the end user's expectation of the device's functionality. We design and implement GoodUSB, a mediation architecture for the Linux USB Stack. We defend against BadUSB attacks by enforcing permissions based on user expectations of device functionality. GoodUSB includes a security image component to simplify use, and a honeypot mechanism for observing suspicious USB activities. GoodUSB introduces only 5.2% performance overhead compared to the unmodified Linux USB subsystem.

While,"A progressive web application (PWA) becomes an attractive option for building universal applications based on feature-rich web Application Programming Interfaces (APIs). While flexible, such vast APIs inevitably bring a significant increase in an API attack surface, which commonly corresponds to a functionality that is neither needed nor wanted by the application. A promising approach to reduce the API attack surface is software debloating, a technique wherein an unused functionality is programmatically removed from an application. Unfortunately, debloating PWAs is challenging, given the monolithic design and non-deterministic execution of a modern web browser. In this paper, we present DeView, a practical approach that reduces the attack surface of a PWA by blocking unnecessary but accessible web APIs. DeView tackles the challenges of PWA debloating by i) record-and-replay web API profiling that identifies needed web APIs on an app-by-app basis by replaying (recorded) browser interactions and ii) compiler-assisted browser debloating that eliminates the entry functions of corresponding web APIs from the mapping between web API and its entry point in a binary.

In order to more effectively detect, disrupt and dismantle illicit drug trades, there’s an imminent need to gain a deeper understanding toward the operations and dynamics of illicit drug trading activities. To address this challenge, in this paper, we design and develop an intelligent system (named dSytle-GAN) to automate the analysis for drug identification in darknet markets, by considering both content-based and style-aware information. To determine whether a given pair of posted drugs are the same or not, in dStyle-GAN, based on the large-scale data collected from darknet markets, we first present an attributed heterogeneous information network (AHIN) to depict drugs, vendors, texts and writing styles, photos and photography styles, and the rich relations among them; and then we propose a novel generative adversarial network (GAN) based model over AHIN to capture the underlying distribution of posted drugs’ writing and photography styles to learn robust representations of drugs for their identifications. Unlike existing approaches, our proposed GAN-based model jointly considers the heterogeneity of network and relatedness over drugs formulated by domain-specific meta-paths for robust node (i.e., drug) representation learning. To the best of our knowledge, the proposed dStyle-GAN represents the first principled GAN-based solution over graphs to simultaneously consider writing and photography styles as well as their latent distributions for node representation learning.

To this end, we introduce a new authentication scheme, called Group TOTP (GTOTP), that allows the prover to prove that it is a member of an authenticated group without revealing its identity. We propose a novel construction that transforms any asymmetric TOTP scheme into a GTOTP scheme. Our approach combines Merkle tree and Bloom filter to reduce the verifier’s states to constant sizes.As a promising application of GTOTP, we show that GTOTP can be used to construct an efficient privacy-preserving Proof of Location (PoL) scheme.

We conduct extensive experiments on two typical datasets that were manually poisoned using different attack strategies. Experimental results show that the MDR achieves backdoored samples removal rate greater than 99.0% for different datasets and attack conditions, while maintaining an extremely low false positive rate of less than 0.1%.

In addition, the device is desired to be automatically disposable after the expiration of its service, software, or device hardware to prevent being cyber debris.We present Reboot-Oriented IoT (RO-IoT), which updates the total OS image autonomously to recover from compromise (rootkit or otherwise), and manages the life cycle of the device using Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) and PKI-based certificates (i.e., CA, server, and client certificates which are linked to device, software, and service). RO-IoT is composed of three TEE-protected components: the secure network bootloader, periodic memory forensics, and life cycle management. The secure network bootloader downloads and verifies the OS image by the TEE. The periodic memory forensics causes a hardware system-reset (i.e., reboot) after detecting any un-registered binary or a time-out, which depends on a TEE-protected watchdog timer. The life cycle management checks the expiration of PKI-based certificates for the device, software, and service, and deactivates the device if necessary. These features complement each other, and all binaries and certificates are encrypted or protected by TEE. We implemented a prototype of RO-IoT on an ARM Hikey board with the open source trusted OS OP-TEE.

Our primitive RingRAM leverages the observation that, while existing hardware security primitives have limitations that prevent deployment, they can be merged to form a hardware security primitive that has all of the benefits, but none of the drawbacks. We show how RingRAM’s reliance on simple circuit elements enables universal implementation using discrete components, on an FPGA, and as an ASIC. We then design RingRAM tuning knobs that allow designers to increase entropy, decrease noise, and eliminate off-chip post-processing.

A series of payload injection techniques which take advantage of a variety of unique neural network natures like complex structure, high error resilience capability and huge parameter size, are developed for both uncompressed models (with model redundancy) and deeply compressed models tailored for resource-limited devices (no model redundancy), including LSB substitution, resilience training, value mapping, and sign-mapping. We also proposed a set of triggering techniques like logits trigger, rank trigger and fine-tuned rank trigger to trigger StegoNet by specific physical events under realistic environment variations.

As the size of deep neural networks (DNN) continually increases, model quantization, which converts the full-precision model into lower-bit representation while mostly preserving the accuracy, becomes a prerequisite for deploying a well-trained DNN on resource-limited edge devices. However, to properly quantize a DNN requires an essential amount of expert knowledge, or otherwise the model accuracy would be devastatingly affected. Alternatively, recent years witness the birth of third-party model supply chains which provide pretrained quantized neural networks (QNN) for free downloading.
In this paper, we systematically analyze the potential threats of trojaned models in third-party QNN supply chains. For the first time, we describe and implement a QUAntization-SpecIfic backdoor attack (QUASI), which manipulates the quantization mechanism to inject a backdoor specific to the quantized model. In other words, the attacker-specified inputs, or triggers, would not cause misbehaviors of the trojaned model in full precision until the backdoor function is automatically completed by a normal quantization operation, producing a trojaned QNN which can be triggered with a near 100% success rate. Our proposed QUASI attack reveals several key vulnerabilities in the existing QNN supply chains: (i) QUASI demonstrates a third-party QNN released online can also be injected with backdoors, while, unlike full-precision models, there is almost no working algorithm for checking the fidelity of a QNN. (ii) More threateningly, the backdoor injected by QUASI remains inactivated in the full-precision model, which inhibits model consumers from attributing undergoing trojan attacks to the malicious model provider. As a practical implication, we alarm it can be highly risky to accept and deploy third-party QNN on edge devices at the current stage, if without future mitigation studies.",15,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3485832.3485881,"""supply chain"" source:""Computer Security Applications Conference""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While prior work has shown the need for tool support for developers to avoid libraries with security problems, no such a solution has yet been brought forward to Android. It is unclear how such a solution would work and which challenges need to be solved in realizing it.
In this work, we want to make a step forward in this direction.

This paper attempts to remedy this situation. Specifically, it formulates a definition of security for a logic locking mechanism based on indistinguishability and relates the definition to security from actual attackers in a precise and unambiguous manner. We then describe a mechanism that satisfies the definition, thereby achieving (provable) security from all prior attacks. The mechanism assumes the existence of both a puncturable pseudorandom function family and an indistinguishability obfuscator, two cryptographic primitives that exist under well-founded assumptions. The mechanism builds upon the Stripped-Functionality Logic Locking (SFLL) framework, a state-of-the-art family of locking mechanisms whose potential for ever achieving security is currently in question.

A First Look at Security and Privacy Risks in the RapidAPI Ecosystem,"['S Liao', 'L Cheng', 'X Luo', 'Z Song', 'H Cai', 'D Yao']",2024,… and Communications …,"As we discussed in Section 6.2, privacy issues in APIs could propagate to downstream  applications within the software supply chain and cause difficulties for downstream app","With the emergence of the open API ecosystem, third-party developers can publish their APIs on the API marketplace, significantly facilitating the development of cutting-edge features and services. The RapidAPI platform is currently the largest API marketplace and it provides over 40,000 APIs, which have been used by more than 4 million developers. However, such open API also raises security and privacy concerns associated with APIs hosted on the platform. In this work, we perform the first large-scale analysis of 32,089 APIs on the RapidAPI platform. By searching in the GitHub code and Android apps, we find that 3,533 RapidAPI keys, which are important and used in API request authorization, have been leaked in the wild. These keys can be exploited to launch various attacks, such as Resource Exhaustion Running, Theft of Service, Data Manipulation, and User Data Breach attacks. We also explore risks in API metadata that can be abused by adversaries. Due to the lack of a strict certification system, adversaries can manipulate the API metadata to perform typosquatting attacks on API URLs, impersonate other developers or renowned companies, and publish spamming APIs on the platform. Lastly, we analyze the privacy non-compliance of APIs and applications, e.g., Android apps, that call these APIs with data collection. We find that 1,709 APIs collect sensitive data and 94% of them dont provide a complete privacy policy. For the Android apps that call these APIs, 50% of them in our study have privacy non-compliance issues.",1,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3658644.3690294,"""supply chain"" source:""Conference on Computer and Communications Security""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We propose Fides, a novel framework for real-time integrity validation of ML-as-a-Service (MLaaS) inference. Fides features a novel and efficient distillation technique-Greedy Distillation Transfer Learning-that dynamically distills and fine-tunes a space and compute-efficient verification model for verifying the corresponding service model while running inside a trusted execution environment. Fides features a client-side attack detection model that uses statistical analysis and divergence measurements to identify, with a high likelihood, if the service model is under attack. Fides also offers a re-classification functionality that predicts the original class whenever an attack is identified. We devised a generative adversarial network framework for training the attack detection and re-classification models. The evaluation shows that Fides achieves an accuracy of up to 98% for attack detection and 94% for re-classification.",0,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3634737.3657015,"""supply chain"" source:""Conference on Computer and Communications Security""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Answering these key questions is crucial for assessing and mitigating the holistic vulnerabilities of DNNs deployed in realistic settings.
Here we take a solid step towards this goal by conducting the first systematic study of the two attack vectors within a unified framework. Specifically, (i) we develop a new attack model that jointly optimizes adversarial inputs and poisoned models; (ii) with both analytical and empirical evidence, we reveal that there exist intriguing ""mutual reinforcement"" effects between the two attack vectors -- leveraging one vector significantly amplifies the effectiveness of the other; (iii) we demonstrate that such effects enable a large design spectrum for the adversary to enhance the existing attacks that exploit both vectors (e.g., backdoor attacks), such as maximizing the attack evasiveness with respect to various detection methods; (iv) finally, we discuss potential countermeasures against such optimized attacks and their technical challenges, pointing to several promising research directions.",117,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3372297.3417253,"""supply chain"" source:""Conference on Computer and Communications Security""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This reduces production costs, but also exposes ICs to supply chain attacks, where insiders introduce malicious circuitry into the final products. Additionally, despite extensive post-fabrication testing, it is not uncommon for ICs with subtle fabrication errors to make it into production systems. While many systems may be able to tolerate a few byzantine components, this is not the case for cryptographic hardware, storing and computing on confidential data. For this reason, many error and backdoor detection techniques have been proposed over the years. So far all attempts have been either quickly circumvented, or come with unrealistically high manufacturing costs and complexity.
This paper proposes Myst, a practical high-assurance architecture, that uses commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) hardware, and provides strong security guarantees, even in the presence of multiple malicious or faulty components. The key idea is to combine protective-redundancy with modern threshold cryptographic techniques to build a system tolerant to hardware trojans and errors. To evaluate our design, we build a Hardware Security Module that provides the highest level of assurance possible with COTS components. Specifically, we employ more than a hundred COTS secure cryptocoprocessors, verified to FIPS140-2 Level 4 tamper-resistance standards, and use them to realize high-confidentiality random number generation, key derivation, public key decryption and signing. Our experiments show a reasonable computational overhead (less than 1% for both Decryption and Signing) and an exponential increase in backdoor-tolerance as more ICs are added.",50,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3133956.3133961,"""supply chain"" source:""Conference on Computer and Communications Security""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Pre-trained AI models may contain back-doors that are injected through training or by transforming inner neuron weights. These trojaned models operate normally when regular inputs are provided, and mis-classify to a specific output label when the input is stamped with some special pattern called trojan trigger. We develop a novel technique that analyzes inner neuron behaviors by determining how output activations change when we introduce different levels of stimulation to a neuron. The neurons that substantially elevate the activation of a particular output label regardless of the provided input is considered potentially compromised. Trojan trigger is then reverse-engineered through an optimization procedure using the stimulation analysis results, to confirm that a neuron is truly compromised. We evaluate our system ABS on 177 trojaned models that are trojaned with various attack methods that target both the input space and the feature space, and have various trojan trigger sizes and shapes, together with 144 benign models that are trained with different data and initial weight values. These models belong to 7 different model structures and 6 different datasets, including some complex ones such as ImageNet, VGG-Face and ResNet110.

As an important method to detect vulnerabilities, recurring vulnerability detection has not been systematically studied in IoT firmware. In fact, existing methods would meet significant challenges from two aspects. First, firmware vulnerabilities are usually reported in texts without too much code-level information, e.g., security patches. Second, firmware images are released as binaries, making the analysis of known vulnerabilities and the detection of unknown vulnerabilities quite difficult.
This paper presents FirmRec, the first recurring vulnerability detection approach for IoT firmware. FirmRec features several new techniques to enable accurate and efficient vulnerability detection.
First, it proposes a new exploitation-based vulnerability signature representation for firmware, which does not use syntactic code features but the semantic features along the dynamic vulnerability exploitation procedure (thus is more resilient to binary code changes and fits the context of binary-only firmware). Second, given a vulnerability report, it designs concolic execution-based vulnerability signature extraction to understand the vulnerability exploitation procedure and generate an exploitation-based vulnerability signature. Third, based on known vulnerability signatures, it employs a two-stage pipeline to accurately and efficiently detect recurring vulnerabilities. With a dataset of 320 firmware images, FirmRec efficiently detects 642 vulnerabilities. Till now, 53 CVEs have been assigned. Compared with SaTC, jTrans, and Greenhouse, FirmRec detects more vulnerabilities and is more accurate.

To facilitate this fuzzing","In-memory fuzzing, designed to perform direct mutation on memory contents, has gained attention as a technique that enables intensive, efficient testing. To facilitate this fuzzing technique, identifications of mutable buffers, which will be subject to mutation, and fuzzing target functions should be preceded. So far, these identifications have been relied on manual efforts with source code available. Unfortunately, such manual identifications are challenging on binary-only programs due mainly to loss of source-level information during compilation. To address this difficulty, this paper proposes AIMFuzz that supports in-memory fuzzing on binary programs at function level. AIMFuzz largely consists of two stages: the analysis stage that identifies mutable buffers and prioritizes fuzzing target functions based on dynamic taint tracking, and the fuzzing stage that tests the designated target functions by injecting mutated inputs through the identified mutable buffers. Noteworthily, these two stages are carried out automatically, eliminating daunting manual efforts for the binary. Our evaluation results demonstrate that AIMFuzz successfully detects bugs on real applications. AIMFuzz shows great effectiveness in testing selected target functions efficiently and thoroughly, and also comparable performance to the state-of-the-art implementation of in-memory fuzzing with better usability thanks to its automated analysis and testing.",0,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3634737.3644996,"""supply chain"" source:""Conference on Computer and Communications Security""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To enable this understanding, we propose a protocol-agnostic evaluation framework which: determines the viability of an IPS for different attack vectors, scores the suitability of an IDS to powering an IPS for certain attacks, and scores the efficacy of the IDS itself against those same attacks. With our framework we analyze IDS and IPS technologies for the CAN and MIL-STD-1553 serial data bus networks.

Although researchers have proposed many techniques to detect HTs, several critical limitations exist, including: (i) a low success rate of HT detection, (ii) high algorithmic complexity, and (iii) a large number of test patterns. Furthermore, as we show in this work the most pertinent drawback of prior (including state-of-the-art) detection techniques stems from an incorrect evaluation methodology, i.e., they assume that an adversary inserts HTs randomly. Such inappropriate adversarial assumptions enable detection techniques to claim high HT detection accuracy, leading to a ""false sense of security."" To the best of our knowledge, despite more than a decade of research on detecting HTs inserted during fabrication, there have been no concerted efforts to perform a systematic evaluation of HT detection techniques.
In this paper, we play the role of a realistic adversary and question the efficacy of HT detection techniques by developing an automated, scalable, and practical attack framework, ATTRITION, using reinforcement learning (RL). ATTRITION evades eight detection techniques (published in premier security venues, well-cited in academia, etc.) across two HT detection categories, showcasing its agnostic behavior. ATTRITION achieves average attack success rates of 47x and 211x compared to randomly inserted HTs against state-of-the-art logic testing and side channel techniques. To demonstrate ATTRITION's ability in evading detection techniques, we evaluate different designs ranging from the widely-used academic suites (ISCAS-85, ISCAS-89) to larger designs such as the open-source MIPS and mor1kx processors to AES and a GPS module. Additionally, we showcase the impact of ATTRITION generated HTs through two case studies (privilege escalation and kill switch) on mor1kx processor.

Prompt patching is crucial to mitigate the serious consequences of such attacks on these devices. Hotpatching is an approach to apply a patch to mission-critical embedded devices without rebooting them. However, existing hotpatching approaches require developers to manually write the hotpatch for target systems, which is time-consuming and error-prone.
To address these issues, we propose AutoPatch, a new hotpatching technique that automatically generates functionally equivalent hotpatches via static analysis of the official patches. AutoPatch introduces a new software triggering approach that supports diverse embedded devices, and preserves the functionality of the official patch. In contrast to prior work, AutoPatch does not rely on hardware support for triggering patches, or on executing patches in specialized virtual machines. We implemented AutoPatch using the LLVM compiler, and evaluated its efficiency, effectiveness and generality using 62 real CVEs on four embedded devices with different specifications and architectures running popular RTOSes. We found that AutoPatch can fix more than 90% of CVEs, and resolve the vulnerability successfully. The results revealed an average total delay of less than 12.7 μs for fixing the vulnerabilities, representing a performance improvement of 50% over RapidPatch, a state-of-the-art approach. Further, our memory overhead, on average, was slightly lower than theirs (23%).

Although MM provides great utility, it may come with security risks because an adversary can exploit MM to affect multiple downstream tasks. However, the security risks of MM have barely been studied. In this paper, we first find that MM, as a new learning paradigm, introduces unique challenges for existing backdoor attacks due to the merging process. To address these challenges, we introduce BadMerging, the first backdoor attack specifically designed for MM. Notably, BadMerging allows an adversary to compromise the entire merged model by contributing as few as one backdoored task-specific model. BadMerging comprises a two-stage attack mechanism and a novel feature-interpolation-based loss to enhance the robustness of embedded backdoors against the changes of different merging parameters. Considering that a merged model may incorporate tasks from different domains, BadMerging can jointly compromise the tasks provided by the adversary (on-task attack) and other contributors (off-task attack) and solve the corresponding unique challenges with novel attack designs. Extensive experiments show that BadMerging achieves remarkable attacks against various MM algorithms. Our ablation study demonstrates that the proposed attack designs can progressively contribute to the attack performance. Finally, we show that prior defense mechanisms fail to defend against our attacks, highlighting the need for more advanced defense.

Secure multi-party computation offers the possibility of private matching processes that do not rely on any common trusted third party. However, stable matching algorithms have previously been considered infeasible for execution in a secure multi-party context on non-trivial inputs because they are computationally intensive and involve complex data-dependent memory access patterns.
We adapt the classic Gale-Shapley algorithm for use in such a context, and show experimentally that our modifications yield a lower asymptotic complexity and more than an order of magnitude in practical cost improvement over previous techniques. Our main improvements stem from designing new oblivious data structures that exploit the properties of the matching algorithms. We apply a similar strategy to scale the Roth-Peranson instability chaining algorithm, currently in use by the National Resident Matching Program. The resulting protocol is efficient enough to be useful at the scale required for matching medical residents nationwide, taking just over 18 hours to complete an execution simulating the 2016 national resident match with more than 35,000 participants and 30,000 residency slots.",65,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2976749.2978373,"""supply chain"" source:""Conference on Computer and Communications Security""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Nevertheless, these attacks often process multiple intermediate states of the metric independently, ignoring their time-dependent patterns. Consequently, they struggle to effectively distinguish between members and non-members who exhibit similar metric values, particularly resulting in a high false-positive rate.
In this study, we delve deeper into the new membership signals in the black-box scenario. We identify a new, more integrated membership signal: the Pattern of Metric Sequence, derived from the various stages of model training. We contend that current signals provide only partial perspectives of this new signal: the new one encompasses both the model's multiple intermediate and final states, with a greater emphasis on temporal patterns among them. Building upon this signal, we introduce a novel attack method called Sequential-metric based Membership Inference Attack (SeqMIA). Specifically, we utilize knowledge distillation to obtain a set of distilled models representing various stages of the target model's training. We then assess multiple metrics on these distilled models in chronological order, creating distilled metric sequence. We finally integrate distilled multi-metric sequences as a sequential multiformat and employ an attention-based RNN attack model for inference. Empirical results show SeqMIA outperforms all baselines, especially can achieve an order of magnitude improvement in terms of TPR @ 0.1% FPR. Furthermore, we delve into the reasons why this signal contributes to SeqMIA's high attack performance, and assess various defense mechanisms against SeqMIA.",2,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3658644.3690335,"""supply chain"" source:""Conference on Computer and Communications Security""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this paper, we propose Sigstore, a system to provide widespread software signing capabilities. To do so, we designed the system to provide baseline artifact signing capabilities that minimize the adoption barrier for developers. To this end, Sigstore leverages three distinct mechanisms: First, it uses a protocol similar to ACME to authenticate developers through OIDC, tying signatures to existing and widely-used identities. Second, it enables developers to use ephemeral keys to sign their artifacts, reducing the inconvenience and risk of key management. Finally, Sigstore enables user authentication by means of artifact and identity logs, bringing transparency to software signatures.

Software signing provides authenticity, mitigating many such attacks. Developer-managed signing keys pose usability challenges, but certificate-based systems introduce privacy problems. This work, Speranza, uses certificates to verify software authenticity but still provides anonymity to signers using zero-knowledge identity co-commitments.
In Speranza, a signer uses an automated certificate authority (CA) to create a private identity-bound signature and proof of authorization. Verifiers check that a signer was authorized to publish a package without learning the signer's identity. The package repository privately records each package's authorized signers, but publishes only commitments to identities in a public map. Then, when issuing certificates, the CA issues the certificate to a distinct commitment to the same identity. The signer then creates a zero-knowledge proof that these are co-commitments.
We implemented a proof-of-concept for Speranza. We find that costs to maintainers (signing) and end users (verifying) are small (sub-millisecond), even for a repository with millions of packages. Techniques inspired by recent key transparency systems reduce the bandwidth for serving authorization policies to 2 KiB. Server costs in this system are negligible. Our evaluation finds that Speranza is practical on the scale of the largest software repositories.
We also emphasize practicality and deployability in this project. By building on existing technology and employing relatively simple and well-established cryptographic techniques, Speranza can be deployed for wide-scale use with only a few hundred lines of code and minimal changes to existing infrastructure. Speranza is a practical way to bring privacy and authenticity together for more trustworthy open-source software.",14,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3576915.3623200,"""supply chain"" source:""Conference on Computer and Communications Security""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recycled chips, often extracted from","The foundation of trusted computation depends on the ability to verify the authenticity of the underlying hardware. This need is further compounded by the presence of counterfeit components in the market, highlighting the necessity for pre-deployment and run-time chip identification techniques. Current solutions involve burning authentication information in physical fuses or creating a unique mask for each integrated circuit, which are either costly or susceptible to forgery. While many solutions have been proposed to prevent chip counterfeiting at design time, no accurate, reference-free, and cost-effective solutions exist for chip buyers to authenticate their purchases in the pre-deployment phase and enable software-level verification at runtime. The lack of industry-standard authentication methods forces chip buyers to either adopt expensive solutions, such as X-Ray imaging, or simply rely on blind faith.
This paper presents SKU-RAM, a technique for chip identification that allows manufacturers to embed their signature into integrated circuits, provides per-device identification, and facilitates hardware-enforced time-limited licensing functionality. Our approach takes advantage of the aging-induced power-on state changes in SRAM to encode authentication data into an already fabricated device, without modifying the mask of the chips. This hardware-overhead-free augmentation to the chips eliminates numerous instances of chip counterfeiting and enables software-level authentication. We demonstrate the effectiveness of SKU-RAM as a comprehensive and scalable anti-counterfeiting solution for existing and future computing devices using commercial off-the-shelf microcontrollers and microprocessors and multi-year real-time experiments.",0,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3634737.3657011,"""supply chain"" source:""Conference on Computer and Communications Security""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We hope our work will encourage others","We provide an analysis of IEEE standard P1735, which describes methods for encrypting electronic-design intellectual property (IP), as well as the management of access rights for such IP. We find a surprising number of cryptographic mistakes in the standard. In the most egregious cases, these mistakes enable attack vectors that allow us to recover the entire underlying plaintext IP. Some of these attack vectors are well-known, e.g. padding-oracle attacks. Others are new, and are made possible by the need to support the typical uses of the underlying IP; in particular, the need for commercial system-on-chip (SoC) tools to synthesize multiple pieces of IP into a fully specified chip design and to provide syntax errors. We exploit these mistakes in a variety of ways, leveraging a commercial SoC tool as a black-box oracle.
In addition to being able to recover entire plaintext IP, we show how to produce standard-compliant ciphertexts of IP that have been modified to include targeted hardware Trojans. For example, IP that correctly implements the AES block cipher on all but one (arbitrary) plaintext that induces the block cipher to return the secret key. We outline a number of other attacks that the standard allows, including on the cryptographic mechanism for IP licensing. Unfortunately, we show that obvious ""quick fixes"" to the standard (and the tools that support it) do not stop all of our attacks.

Test Suites Guided Vulnerability Validation for Node. js Applications,"['C Luo', 'P Li', 'W Meng', 'C Zhang']",2024,… Computer and Communications Security,"leads to high risk to the software supply chain due to NPM packages’ dependencies on   vulnerabilities (eg, injection vulnerabilities and supply chain attacks) in NPM packages [29,","Dynamic methods have shown great promise in validating vulnerabilities and generating Proof-of-Concept (PoC) exploits of Node.js applications. They typically rely on dictionaries or specifications to determine the values of request parameters and their relationships. However, they still struggle to generate complex inputs from the provided dictionaries or specifications.
This work introduces a novel approach that utilizes existing test suites to automatically generate end-to-end application inputs for vulnerability validation. Our key observation is that Node.js applications often provide comprehensive test suites - in our study, the unit testing code can cover an average of 85% of application code - which can hardly be achieved by existing dynamic methods. We thus design a new system, JSGo, that leverages test suites to construct end-to-end test inputs. Since test suites directly invoke application code instead of issuing requests from client-accessible entry points, we cannot simply transform test suites into application inputs. We instead propose a novel trace-guided mutation mechanism based on concolic execution.
Our evaluation demonstrates that JSGo could reproduce 20 out of 26 known vulnerabilities, which significantly outperformed the state-of-the-art methods Restler, Miner, Witcher, and Burp by 10, 12, 11, 10 more cases, respectively.

Recent studies have demonstrated that an adversary could extract highly sensitive privacy data from the training data of LLMs with carefully designed prompts. However, these attacks suffer from the model's tendency to hallucinate and catastrophic forgetting (CF) in the pre-training stage, rendering the veracity of divulged PIIs negligible. In our research, we propose a novel attack, Janus, which exploits the fine-tuning interface to recover forgotten PIIs from the pre-training data in LLMs. We formalize the privacy leakage problem in LLMs and explain why forgotten PIIs can be recovered through empirical analysis on open-source language models. Based upon these insights, we evaluate the performance of Janus on both open-source language models and two latest LLMs, i.e., GPT-3.5-Turbo and LLaMA-2-7b. Our experiment results show that Janus amplifies the privacy risks by over 10 times in comparison with the baseline and significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art privacy extraction attacks including prefix attacks and in-context learning (ICL). Furthermore, our analysis validates that existing fine-tuning APIs provided by OpenAI and Azure AI Studio are susceptible to our Janus attack, allowing an adversary to conduct such an attack at a low cost.",15,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3658644.3690325,"""supply chain"" source:""Conference on Computer and Communications Security""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Next-generation cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum will include rich scripting languages in support of smart contracts, programs that autonomously intermediate transactions. In this paper, we explore the risk of smart contracts fueling new criminal ecosystems. Specifically, we show how what we call criminal smart contracts (CSCs) can facilitate leakage of confidential information, theft of cryptographic keys, and various real-world crimes (murder, arson, terrorism).
We show that CSCs for leakage of secrets (a la Wikileaks) are efficiently realizable in existing scripting languages such as that in Ethereum. We show that CSCs for theft of cryptographic keys can be achieved using primitives, such as Succinct Non-interactive ARguments of Knowledge (SNARKs), that are already expressible in these languages and for which efficient supporting language extensions are anticipated. We show similarly that authenticated data feeds, an emerging feature of smart contract systems, can facilitate CSCs for real-world crimes (e.g., property crimes).

However, the security of these systems has yet to be completely explored, leaving potential attack surfaces that can be exploited to take control over critical systems.
In this paper we investigate the reliability of temperature-based control systems from a security and safety perspective. We show how unexpected consequences and safety risks can be induced by physical-level attacks on analog temperature sensing components. For instance, we demonstrate that an adversary could remotely manipulate the temperature sensor measurements of an infant incubator to cause potential safety issues, without tampering with the victim system or triggering automatic temperature alarms. This attack exploits the unintended rectification effect that can be induced in operational and instrumentation amplifiers to control the sensor output, tricking the internal control loop of the victim system to heat up or cool down. Furthermore, we show how the exploit of this hardware-level vulnerability could affect different classes of analog sensors that share similar signal conditioning processes.

At the same time, society has serious concerns about how adversaries can exploit such models to generate problematic or unsafe images. In this work, we focus on demystifying the generation of unsafe images and hateful memes from Text-to-Image models. We first construct a typology of unsafe images consisting of five categories (sexually explicit, violent, disturbing, hateful, and political). Then, we assess the proportion of unsafe images generated by four advanced Text-to-Image models using four prompt datasets. We find that Text-to-Image models can generate a substantial percentage of unsafe images; across four models and four prompt datasets, 14.56% of all generated images are unsafe. When comparing the four Text-to-Image models, we find different risk levels, with Stable Diffusion being the most prone to generating unsafe content (18.92% of all generated images are unsafe). Given Stable Diffusion's tendency to generate more unsafe content, we evaluate its potential to generate hateful meme variants if exploited by an adversary to attack a specific individual or community. We employ three image editing methods, DreamBooth, Textual Inversion, and SDEdit, which are supported by Stable Diffusion to generate variants. Our evaluation result shows that 24% of the generated images using DreamBooth are hateful meme variants that present the features of the original hateful meme and the target individual/community; these generated images are comparable to hateful meme variants collected from the real world. Overall, our results demonstrate that the danger of large-scale generation of unsafe images is imminent. We discuss several mitigating measures, such as curating training data, regulating prompts, and implementing safety filters, and encourage better safeguard tools to be developed to prevent unsafe generation.1 Our code is available at https://github.com/YitingQu/unsafe-diffusion.",98,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3576915.3616679,"""supply chain"" source:""Conference on Computer and Communications Security""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, this growth has also led to an increase in ad fraud, such as click injection, background ad activity, etc. While existing studies have primarily concentrated on ad fraud within individual apps or devices, this paper introduces a new form of collusion-based ad fraud, named ad attribution laundering fraud (ALF). ALF involves multiple apps collaborating to deceive advertisers by misrepresenting the app where ads are displayed. The collusion-based approach allows lower-quality apps to exploit the reputable identities of seemingly legitimate apps. This deceives advertisers or ad networks into believing that the advertisements they place are reaching potentially valid end-users on the legitimate app. The seemingly legitimate ad events and ad attribution procedures employed by individual apps in such attacks can evade detection by existing tools.
To detect ALF, we design and implement the first detection framework, AlfScan. It overcomes two challenges to extract apps' identities from diverse and obfuscated apps using both static and dynamic analysis techniques, then cross-check the identities to identify ALF. We evaluate AlfScan on a 200-app ground truth dataset, and it achieves 92% precision and 92% recall.

RRPs are a new class of pseudonyms whose validity can be revoked for any time-range within its original validity period.

We provide an algorithm to implement RRPs using efficient cryptographic primitives where the space complexity of the pseudonym is constant, regardless of the granularity of the revocation range, and the space complexity of the revocation information only grows logarithmically with the granularity; this makes the use of RRPs far more efficient than the use of many short-lived pseudonyms. We have used RRPs to design EDGAR, an access control system for VANET scenarios that offers backward unlinkability.

VMUD: Detecting Recurring Vulnerabilities with Multiple Fixing Functions via Function Selection and Semantic Equivalent Statement Matching,"['K Huang', 'C Lu', 'Y Cao', 'B Chen', 'X Peng']",2024,… and Communications Security,"vulnerabilities in open-source software have raised significant concerns, such as inaccurate  vulnerability reports [6, 58], silent vulnerability fixes [64], and software supply chain attacks [7","The widespread use of open-source software (OSS) has led to extensive code reuse, making vulnerabilities in OSS significantly pervasive. The vulnerabilities due to code reuse in OSS are commonly known as vulnerable code clones (VCCs) or recurring vulnerabilities. Existing approaches primarily employ clone-based techniques to detect recurring vulnerabilities by matching vulnerable functions in software projects. These techniques do not incorporate specially designed mechanisms for vulnerabilities with multiple fixing functions (VM). Typically, they generate a signature for each fixing function and report VM using a matching-one-in-all approach. However, the variation in vulnerability context across diverse fixing functions results in varying accuracy levels in detecting VM, potentially limiting the effectiveness of existing methods.
In this paper, we introduce VMud, a novel approach for detecting Vulnerabilities with Multiple Fixing Functions. VMud identifies vulnerable function clones (VCCs) through function matching similar to existing methods. However, VMud takes a different approach by only selecting the critical functions from VM for signature generation, which are a subset of the fixing functions. This step ensures that VMud focuses on fixing functions that offer sufficient knowledge about the VM. To cope with the potential decrease in recall due to excluding the remaining fixing functions, VMud employs semantic equivalent statement matching using these critical functions. It aims to uncover more VM by creating two signatures of each critical function and matching precisely by contextual semantic equivalent statement mapping on the two signatures. Our evaluation has demonstrated that VMud surpasses state-of-the-art vulnerability detection approaches by 30.30% in terms of F1-Score. Furthermore, VMud has successfully detected 275 new VM from 84 projects, with 42 confirmed cases and 5 assigned CVE identifiers.",1,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3658644.3690372,"""supply chain"" source:""Conference on Computer and Communications Security""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For example, a trigger of sunglasses could mislead a facial recognition model when either an arbitrary (source-class-agnostic) or a specific (source-class-specific) person wears sunglasses. Existing defense strategiesoverwhelmingly focus on countering VCB attacks, especially those that are source-class-agnostic. This narrow focus neglects the potential threat of other simpler yet general backdoor types, leading to false security implications. It is, therefore, crucial to discover and elucidate unknown backdoor types, particularly those that can be easily implemented, as a mandatory step before developing countermeasures.
This study introduces a new, simple, and general type of backdoor attack, the horizontal class backdoor (HCB), that trivially breaches the class dependence characteristic of the VCB, bringing a fresh perspective to the field. An HCB is activated when the trigger is presented together with an innocuous feature,regardless of class. For example, under an HCB, the trigger of sunglasses could mislead a facial recognition model in the presence of the innocuous feature smiling. Smiling is innocuous because it is irrelevant to the main task of facial recognition. The key is that these innocuous features (such as rain, fog, or snow in autonomous driving or facial expressions like smiling or sadness in facial recognition) are horizontally sharedamong classes but are only exhibited by partial samples per class. Extensive experiments on attacking performance across various tasks, including MNIST, facial recognition, traffic sign recognition, object detection, and medical diagnosis, confirm the high efficiency and effectiveness of the HCB. We rigorously evaluated the evasiveness of the HCB against a series of eleven representative countermeasures, including Fine-Pruning (RAID 18'), STRIP (ACSAC 19'), Neural Cleanse (Oakland 19'), ABS (CCS 19'), Februus (ACSAC 20'), NAD (ICLR 21'), MNTD (Oakland 21'), SCAn (USENIX SEC 21'), MOTH (Oakland 22'), Beatrix (NDSS 23'), and MM-BD (Oakland 24'). None of these countermeasures prove robustness, even when employing a simplistic trigger, such as a small and static white-square patch.

In the context of machine learning (ML), the right to be forgotten requires an ML model owner to remove the data owner's data from the training set used to build the ML model, a process known asmachine unlearning. While originally designed to protect the privacy of the data owner, we argue that machine unlearning may leave some imprint of the data in the ML model and thus create unintended privacy risks. In this paper, we perform the first study on investigating the unintended information leakage caused by machine unlearning. We propose a novel membership inference attack that leverages the different outputs of an ML model's two versions to infer whether a target sample is part of the training set of the original model but out of the training set of the corresponding unlearned model. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed membership inference attack achieves strong performance. More importantly, we show that our attack in multiple cases outperforms the classical membership inference attack on the original ML model, which indicates that machine unlearning can have counterproductive effects on privacy. We notice that the privacy degradation is especially significant for well-generalized ML models where classical membership inference does not perform well. We further investigate four mechanisms to mitigate the newly discovered privacy risks and show that releasing the predicted label only, temperature scaling, and differential privacy are effective. We believe that our results can help improve privacy protection in practical implementations of machine unlearning. \footnoteOur code is available at \urlhttps://github.com/MinChen00/UnlearningLeaks.",260,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3460120.3484756,"""supply chain"" source:""Conference on Computer and Communications Security""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In such an attack Recently publicized  software supply chain attacks have  install-time software supply chain compromise by proposing,"The npm software ecosystem allows developers to easily import code written by others. However, manual vetting of every individual installed component is made difficult in many cases by the number of transitive dependencies brought in by installing popular packages. This has enabled attackers to propagate malicious code by hiding it deep into the dependency chains of popular packages. A particularly dangerous form of attack comes from malicious code embedded into package install scripts.
We tackle the problem of preventing undesirable install-time behavior by proposing Latch, a system for mediating install-time capabilities of npm packages. Latch generates permission manifests summarizing each package's install-time behavior and checks them against user-defined policies to ensure compliance. Policies in Latch are expressed in a rich formal policy language that covers a broad range of use cases. Our key insight is that expressive Latch policies empower users to define and enforce their own individualized security needs.
Evaluation of practical Latch policies on all publicly available npm packages and on a number of real-world attack packages demonstrates that our approach is effective in identifying and stopping unwanted behavior while minimizing disruption due to undesired alerts.",34,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3488932.3523262,"""supply chain"" source:""Conference on Computer and Communications Security""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We present X-Ray-TLS, a new target-agnostic TLS decryption method that supports TLS 1.2, TLS 1.3, and QUIC. Our method relies only on existing kernel facilities and does not require a hypervisor or modification of the target programs, making it easily applicable at scale. X-Ray-TLS works on major TLS libraries by extracting TLS secrets from process memory using a memory changes reconstruction algorithm. It works with TLS hardening, such as certificate pinning and perfect forward secrecy. We benchmark X-Ray-TLS on major TLS libraries, CLI tools, and a web browser. We show that X-Ray-TLS significantly reduces the manual effort required to decrypt TLS traffic of programs running locally, thus simplifying security analysis or reverse engineering.

on a rule-based local-planning algorithm, specifically focusing on
the planning cost-based function, which is used to estimate the

environment, we conduct a sensitivity analysis using multiple
deviation range values and time-delay duration. We find that
the impact of adversarial attack cases is visible in the rate of
failure to complete the mission and in the occurrence of safety
violations. The cost-function is sensitive to deviations in lateral
and longitudinal pose and higher duration of message delay.
The result of the sensitivity analysis suggests minor deviations

machine learning models using distributed data. This approach
offers benefits such as improved data privacy, reduced communication costs, and enhanced model performance through
increased data diversity. However, FL systems are vulnerable
to poisoning attacks, where adversaries introduce malicious
updates to compromise the integrity of the aggregated model.
Existing defense strategies against such attacks include filtering,
influence reduction, and robust aggregation techniques. Filtering
approaches have the advantage of not reducing classification
accuracy, but face the challenge of adversaries adapting to the
defense mechanisms. The lack of a universally accepted definition of “adaptive adversaries” in the literature complicates the
assessment of detection capabilities and meaningful comparisons
of FL defenses. In this paper, we address the limitations of the
commonly used definition of “adaptive attackers” proposed by
Bagdasaryan et al. We propose AutoAdapt, a novel adaptation
method that leverages an Augmented Lagrangian optimization
technique. AutoAdapt eliminates the manual search for optimal
hyper-parameters by providing a more rational alternative. It
generates more effective solutions by accommodating multiple
inequality constraints, allowing adaptation to valid value ranges
within the defensive metrics. Our proposed method significantly
enhances adversaries’ capabilities and accelerates research in
developing attacks and defenses. By accommodating multiple
valid range constraints and adapting to diverse defense metrics, AutoAdapt challenges defenses relying on multiple metrics and expands the range of potential adversarial behaviors.
Through comprehensive studies, we demonstrate the effectiveness
of AutoAdapt in simultaneously adapting to multiple constraints
and showcasing its power by accelerating the performance of
tests by a factor of 15. Furthermore, we establish the versatility
of AutoAdapt across various application scenarios, encompassing
datasets, model architectures, and hyper-parameters, emphasizing its practical utility in real-world contexts. Overall, our

Basic tags of the “smart-label” variety are likely to serve as a next-generation replacement for barcodes. This would introduce a strong potential for various forms of privacy infringement, such as invasive physical tracking and inventorying of individuals.Researchers have proposed several types of external devices of moderate-to-high computational ability that interact with RFID devices with the aim of protecting user privacy. In this paper, we propose a new design principle for a personal RFID-privacy device. We refer to such a device as a REP (RFID Enhancer Proxy).Briefly stated, a REP assumes the identities of tags and simulates them by proxy. By merit of its greater computing power, the REP can enforce more sophisticated privacy policies than those available in tags. (As a side benefit, it can also provide more flexible and reliable communications in RFID systems.) Previous, similar systems have been vulnerable to a serious attack, namely malicious exchange of data between RFID tags. An important contribution of our proposal is a technique that helps prevent this attack, even when tags do not have access-control features.",166,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/11767831_14,"""supply chain"" source:""Privacy Enhancing Technologies""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the current work, we study the problem of ranking the nodes when the underlying graph is distributedly held by a set of individuals, who consider their share of the data as private information. In particular, we design efficient secure multiparty computation (MPC) protocols for k-Shell decomposition, PageRank and VoteRank. For improved efficiency, we employ the oblivious RAM construct in conjunction with efficient data-oblivious graph data structures. We are the first to propose a secure variant of the VoteRank algorithm.

Nevertheless, studies show that users remain concerned about their privacy and vendors have similarly been increasing their utilization of privacy-preserving technologies in these devices. Still, despite significant efforts, these technologies continue to fail in fundamental ways, leaving users’ private data exposed.

Whereas the individual components have been generally well studied and understood, examining the entire mobile device ecosystem provides significant insights into its overwhelming complexity. The numerous components of this complex ecosystem are frequently built and controlled by different parties with varying interests and incentives. Moreover, most of these parties are unknown to the typical user. The technologies that are employed to protect the users’ privacy typically only do so within a small slice of this ecosystem, abstracting away the greater complexity of the system. Our analysis suggests that this abstracted complexity is the major cause of many privacy-related vulnerabilities, and that a fundamentally new, holistic, approach to privacy is needed going forward.

We consider a new natural privacy notion for BLE broadcasting beacons which we call ``Timed-sequence- indistinguishability'' of beacons. This new privacy definition is stronger than the well-known indistinguishability, since it considers not just the advertisements' content, but also the advertisements' broadcasting times which are observable in the physical world. We then prove that beacons with periodically changing pseudorandom identities do not achieve timed-sequence- indistinguishability. We do this by presenting a novel privacy attack against BLE beacons, which we call the ``Battery Insertion Attack.'' This new time-based privacy attack can be executed by merely inserting or reinserting the beacon's battery at the adversary's chosen time. We performed this attack against an actually deployed beacon. To mitigate the ``Battery Insertion Attack'' and other attacks associated with periodic signaling, we propose a new countermeasure involving quasi-periodic randomized scheduling of identity changes. We prove that our countermeasure ensures timed-sequence indistinguishability for beacons, thereby enhancing the beacon's privacy.

While the differentially private training algorithm is a promising defense method, it faces significant challenges: 1) simultaneously limiting the fitting of clean and poisoned samples induces the degradation of clean accuracy, and 2) maintaining model stability struggles when poisoned samples dominate the target class. To address these challenges, we propose theBi-optimization Training Strategy, which integrates robust training with poisoned sample filtering techniques and conducts asynchronous optimization to complete the defense. Next, to implement this strategy, we combine theDifferentiallyPrivate training algorithm with theConfusion training method to unveil a practical defense framework (DPC). This approach focuses on filtering out poisoned samples and retraining the model with the rest. To take full advantage of inherent stability of the differentially private training algorithm, even the poisoned samples dominate the target class, we adopt self-supervised pre-training to treat poisoned samples as outliers in the latent space. Then, the supervised fine-tuning algorithm enhanced with differential privacy can effectively limit the fitting of these poisoned samples. Additionally, we adaptively adjust the strength of differential privacy protection based on insights from filtered samples, improving clean sample fitting and further strengthening poison samples detection.

Optimality is measured with respect to the overall (1) monetary cost of implementation, (2) negative side-effects of cyber-security controls (indirect costs), and (3) mitigation of the cyber-security risk. We consider “passive” and “reactive” threats, the former representing the case where attack attempts are independent of the defender’s plan, the latter, where attackers can adapt and react to an implemented cyber-security defense. Moreover, we model in three different ways the combined effect of multiple cyber-security controls, depending on their degree of complementarity and correlation. We also consider multi-stage attacks and the potential correlations in the success of different stages. First, we formalize the problem as a non-linear multi-objective integer programming. We then convert them into Mixed Integer Linear Programs (MILP) that very efficiently solve for the exact Pareto-optimal solutions even when the number of available controls is large. In our case study, we consider 27 of the most typical security controls, each with multiple intensity levels of implementation, and 37 common vulnerabilities facing a typical SME. We compare our findings against expert-recommended critical controls. We then investigate the effect of the security models on the resulting optimal plan and contrast the merits of different security metrics. In particular, we show the superior robustness of the security measures based on the “reactive” threat model, and the significance of the hitherto overlooked role of correlations.",16,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-45741-3_10,"""supply chain"" source:""Research in Computer Security""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is undergoing a major digital transformation introducing changes to its operations and technology. The International Maritime Organization urged the maritime community to introduce cyber risk management into their systems. This includes the continuous identification and analysis of the threat landscape. This paper investigates a novel threat against the maritime infrastructure that utilizes a prominent maritime system that is the Automatic Identification System (AIS) for establishing covert channels. We provide empirical evidence regarding its feasibility and applicability to existing and future maritime systems as well as discuss mitigation measures against it. Additionally, we demonstrate the utility of the covert channels by introducing two realistic cyber attacks against an Autonomous Passenger Ship (APS) emulated in a testing environment. Our findings confirm that AIS can be utilized for establishing covert channels for communicating Command & Control (C &C) messages and transferring small files for updating the cyber arsenal without internet access. Also, the establishment and utilization of the covert channels have been found to be possible using existing attack vectors and technologies related to a wide range of maritime systems.

Both the evasion attacks and the poisoning attacks attempt to utilize adversarially altered samples to fool the victim model to misclassify the adversarial sample. While such attacks claim to be or are expected to be stealthy, i.e., imperceptible to human eyes, such claims are rarely evaluated. In this paper, we present the first large-scale study on the stealthiness of adversarial samples used in the attacks against deep learning. We have implemented 20 representative adversarial ML attacks on six popular benchmarking datasets. We evaluate the stealthiness of the attack samples using two complementary approaches: (1) a numerical study that adopts 24 metrics for image similarity or quality assessment; and (2) a user study of 3 sets of questionnaires that has collected 30,000+ annotations from 1,500+ responses. Our results show that the majority of the existing attacks introduce non-negligible perturbations that are not stealthy to human eyes. We further analyze the factors that contribute to attack stealthiness. We examine the correlation between the numerical analysis and the user studies, and demonstrate that some image quality metrics may provide useful guidance in attack designs, while there is still a significant gap between assessed image quality and visual stealthiness of attacks.",2,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-17143-7_17,"""supply chain"" source:""Research in Computer Security""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We use a goal-oriented approach to analyze the purposes of a Hippocratic system and derive a purpose and delegation hierarchy. Based on this hierarchy, effective algorithms are given to determine the minimum set of authorizations needed for a service. In this way, the minimal authorization table of a global business process can be automatically constructed from the collection of privacy policy tables associated with the collaborating enterprises.

Unaffordable price holds back many potential applications of deep learning. Besides, it is risky to gather user’s private data for training centrally. Then federated learning appears as a promising solution to having users learned jointly while keeping training data local. However, security issues keep coming up in federated learning applications. One of the most threatening attacks is the model poisoning attack which can manipulate the inference result of a jointly learned model. Some recent studies show that elaborate model poisoning approaches can even breach the existing Byzantine-robust federated learning solutions. Hence, it is critical to discuss alternative solutions to secure federated learning. In this paper, we propose to protect federated learning against model poisoning attacks by introducing a robust model aggregation solution named Romoa. Unlike previous studies, Romoa can deal with targeted and untargeted poisoning attacks with a unified approach. Moreover, Romoa achieves more precise attack detection and better fairness for federated learning participants by constructing a new similarity measurement. We conclude that through a comprehensive evaluation of standard datasets, Romoa can provide a satisfying defense effect against model poisoning attacks, including those attacks breaching Byzantine-robust federated learning solutions.",50,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-88418-5_23,"""supply chain"" source:""Research in Computer Security""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although AEG systems are instrumental in probing for vulnerabilities, they often lack the capability to contend with defense mechanisms such as vulnerability mitigation, which are commonly deployed in target environments. This shortfall presents significant challenges in exploitation. Additionally, most frameworks are tailored to specific vulnerabilities, rendering their extension a complex process that necessitates in-depth familiarity with their architectures. To overcome these limitations, we introduce the SAEG framework, which streamlines the repetitious aspects of existing exploit templates through a modular and extensible state machine that builds upon the concept of an Exploit Graph. SAEG can methodically filter out impractical exploitation paths by utilizing current information and the target program’s state. Additionally, it simplifies the integration of new information leakage methods with minimal overhead and handles multi-step exploitation procedures, including those requiring the leakage of sensitive data.

In particular, in the context of an NFC transaction, the bank server can validate the transaction if both the NFC phone and reader are precisely at the same location thereby preventing a form of a devastating relay attack against such systems.In this paper, we develop secure proximity detection techniques based on the information collected by ambient sensors available on NFC mobile phones, such as audio and light data. These techniques can work under the current payment infrastructure, and offer many advantages. First, they do not require the users to perform explicit actions, or make security decisions, during the transaction – just bringing the devices close to each other is sufficient. Second, being based on environmental attributes, they make it very hard, if not impossible, for the adversary to undermine the security of the system. Third, they provide a natural protection to users’ location privacy as the explicit location information is never transmitted to the server. Our experiments with the proposed techniques developed on off-the-shelf mobile phones indicate them to be quite effective in significantly raising the bar against known attacks, without affecting the NFC usage model. Although the focus of this work is on NFC phones, our approach will also be broadly applicable to RFID tags or related payment cards equipped with on-board audio or light sensors.",139,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-33167-1_22,"""supply chain"" source:""Research in Computer Security""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To do so securely, a commonly accepted ad-hoc method stipulates that the old software version first retrieves the update information from the vendor’s public repository, then checks that a cryptographic signature embedded into it verifies with the vendor’s public key, and finally replaces itself with the new version. This updating method seems to be robust and lightweight, and to reliably ensure that no malicious third party (e.g., a distribution mirror) can inject harmful code into the update process. Unfortunately, recent prominent news reports (SolarWinds, Stuxnet, TikTok, Zoom, ...) suggest that nation state adversaries are broadening their efforts related to attacking software supply chains. This calls for a critical re-evaluation of the described signature based updating method with respect to the real-world security it provides against particularly powerful adversaries.We approach the setting by formalizing a cryptographic primitive that addresses specifically the secure software updating problem. We define strong, rigorous security models that capture forward security (stealing a vendor’s key today doesn’t allow modifying yesterday’s software version) as well as a form of self-enforcement that helps protecting vendors against coercion attacks in which they are forced, e.g. by nation state actors, to misuse or disclose their keys. We note that the common signature based software authentication method described above meets neither the one nor the other goal, and thus represents a suboptimal solution.

While the use of public key cryptography in RFID tags mitigates many difficult security issues, certain important usability-related issues remain, particularly when RFID tags are used for financial transactions or for bearer identification.In this paper, we focus exclusively ontechniques with user involvementfor secure user-to-tag authentication, transaction verification, reader expiration and revocation checking, as well as association of RFID tags with other personal devices. Our approach is based on two factors: (1) recent advances in hardware and manufacturing have made it possible to mass-produce inexpensive passive display-equipped RFID tags, and (2) high-end RFID tags used in financial transactions or identification are usually attended by a human user (namely the owner). Our techniques rely on user involvement coupled with on-tag displays to achieve better security and privacy.

However, clouds may not perform model training correctly due to the potential violations on Service Level Agreement (SLA) and attacks, incurring low quality of outsourced training. It is challenging for customers to understand the quality of outsourced training on clouds. They cannot measure the quality by simply testing the trained models because the testing performance is impacted by various factors, e.g., the quality of training and testing data. In order to address these issues, in this paper, we propose a novel framework that allows customers to verify the quality of outsourced training without modifying the processes of model training. Particularly, our framework achieves black-box verification by utilizing an extra training task that can be learned by the model only after the model converges on the original training task. We construct well-designed extra training tasks according to the original tasks, and develop a training quality verification method to measure the model performance on the extra task with a hypothesis testing-based threshold. The experiment results show that the models passing the quality verification achieve at least 96% of their best performance with negligible accuracy loss, i.e., less than 0.25%.",4,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-17146-8_7,"""supply chain"" source:""Research in Computer Security""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We further study different training and inference strategies to achieve minimal changes to the semantics and correctness of the input text.AWT is the first end-to-end model to hide data in text by automatically learning -without ground truth- word substitutions along with their locations in order to encode the message.

Examples include side-channel analysis, bus probing, device cloning, or implanting hardware Trojans. Defending against these kinds of attacks is considered a challenging endeavor, requiring anti-tamper solutions to monitor the physical environment of the system. Current solutions range from simple switches, which detect if a case is opened, to meshes of conducting material that provide more fine-grained detection of integrity violations. However, these solutions suffer from an intricate trade-off between physical security on the one side and reliability, cost, and difficulty to manufacture on the other.In this work, we demonstrate that radio wave propagation in an enclosed system of complex geometry is sensitive against adversarial physical manipulation. We present an anti-tamper radio (ATR) solution as a method for tamper detection, which combines high detection sensitivity and reliability with ease-of-use. ATR constantly monitors the wireless signal propagation behavior within the boundaries of a metal case. Tamper attempts such as insertion of foreign objects, will alter the observed radio signal response, subsequently raising an alarm.The ATR principle is applicable in many computing systems that require physical security such as servers, ATMs, and smart meters. As a case study, we use 19” servers and thoroughly investigate capabilities and limits of the ATR. Using a custom-built automated probing station, we simulate probing attacks by inserting needles with high precision into protected environments. Our experimental results show that our ATR implementation can detect 16mm insertions of needles of diameter as low as 0.1mm under ideal conditions. In the more realistic environment of a running 19” server, we demonstrate reliable detection of 40mm insertions of needles of diameter 1mm for a period of 10 days.",9,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9833631/,"""supply chain"" source:""Symposium on Security and Privacy""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While existing efforts","Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are vulnerable to backdoor attacks, which poison the training set to alter the model prediction over samples with a specific trigger. While existing efforts mainly focus on unimodal scenarios, modern AI systems usually employ multiple modalities to improve the model performance, making multimodal backdoor attacks more practical but structurally more complex due to inherent modality interactions, multiple attack surfaces, unbalanced modality contributions, etc. These factors affect the effectiveness of backdooring multimodal learning significantly but have not been fully investigated yet.To bridge this gap, we present the first data and computation efficient backdoor attacks towards multimodal learning. Our solution consists of two innovations. First, we propose a novel backdoor gradient-based score (BAGS), which can accurately quantify the contribution of each data sample to the backdoor learning at a very early training stage. Therefore, it can greatly save time and computational resources for the attacker. Second, we introduce a searching strategy with two attack modes to efficiently determine the optimal poisoning modalities and data samples.Our methodology leads to the following research outcomes. First, we comprehensively evaluate the proposed solution over state-of-the-art multimodal tasks, models, datasets and settings, to verify its effectiveness, efficiency and transferability. For instance, we only need to poison 0.005% of training samples to attack the Visual Question Answering task with the success rate of >96%. For the Audio Video Speech Recognition task, we poison 0.05% of samples to achieve the success rate of >93%. Second, we disclose several interesting findings during our experiments: (1) poisoning all modalities is not always better than individual ones, sometimes even making the attack worse; (2) modality competition and complementarity coexist in multimodal learning backdoor attacks; (3) A dominant modality in multimodal learning may not dominate the backdoor attacks.

The pre-trained image encoder can then be used as a feature extractor to build downstream classifiers for many downstream tasks with a small amount of or no labeled training data. In this work, we propose BadEncoder, the first backdoor attack to self-supervised learning. In particular, our BadEncoder injects backdoors into a pre-trained image encoder such that the downstream classifiers built based on the backdoored image encoder for different downstream tasks simultaneously inherit the backdoor behavior. We formulate our BadEncoder as an optimization problem and we propose a gradient descent based method to solve it, which produces a backdoored image encoder from a clean one. Our extensive empirical evaluation results on multiple datasets show that our BadEncoder achieves high attack success rates while preserving the accuracy of the downstream classifiers.

Old-school backdoor attacks use strong trigger features that can easily be learned by victim models. Despite robustness against input variation, the robustness however increases the likelihood of unintentional trigger activations. This leaves traces to existing defenses, which find approximate replacements for the original triggers that can activate the backdoor without being identical to the original trigger via, e.g., reverse engineering and sample overlay.In this paper, we propose and investigate a new characteristic of backdoor attacks, namely, backdoor exclusivity, which measures the ability of backdoor triggers to remain effective in the presence of input variation. Building upon the concept of backdoor exclusivity, we propose Backdoor Exclusivity LifTing (BELT), a novel technique which suppresses the association between the backdoor and fuzzy triggers to enhance backdoor exclusivity for defense evasion. Extensive evaluation on three popular backdoor benchmarks validate, our approach substantially enhances the stealthiness of four old-school backdoor attacks, which, after backdoor exclusivity lifting, is able to evade seven state-of-the-art backdoor countermeasures, at almost no cost of the attack success rate and normal utility.

However, traditional differentially private mechanisms tend to produce unbounded outputs in order to achieve maximum disturbance range, which is not always in line with real-world applications. Existing solutions attempt to address this issue by employing post-processing or truncation techniques to restrict the output results, but at the cost of introducing bias issues. In this paper, we propose a novel differentially private mechanism which uses a composite probability density function to generate bounded and unbiased outputs for any numerical input data. The composition consists of an activation function and a base function, providing users with the flexibility to define the functions according to the DP constraints. We also develop an optimization algorithm that enables the iterative search for the optimal hyper-parameter setting without the need for repeated experiments, which prevents additional privacy overhead. Furthermore, we evaluate the utility of the proposed mechanism by assessing the variance of the composite probability density function and introducing two alternative metrics that are simpler to compute than variance estimation.

It is used throughout Europe and much of Asia, and is starting to be introduced in North America too. Payment cards contain a chip so they can execute an authentication protocol. This protocol requires point-of-sale (POS) terminals or ATMs to generate a nonce, called the unpredictable number, for each transaction to ensure it is fresh. We have discovered two serious problems: a widespread implementation flaw and a deeper, more difficult to fix flaw with the EMV protocol itself. The first flaw is that some EMV implementers have merely used counters, timestamps or home-grown algorithms to supply this nonce. This exposes them to a ""pre-play"" attack which is indistinguishable from card cloning from the standpoint of the logs available to the card-issuing bank, and can be carried out even if it is impossible to clone a card physically. Card cloning is the very type of fraud that EMV was supposed to prevent. We describe how we detected the vulnerability, a survey methodology we developed to chart the scope of the weakness, evidence from ATM and terminal experiments in the field, and our implementation of proof-of-concept attacks. We found flaws in widely-used ATMs from the largest manufacturers. We can now explain at least some of the increasing number of frauds in which victims are refused refunds by banks which claim that EMV cards cannot be cloned and that a customer involved in a dispute must therefore be mistaken or complicit. The second problem was exposed by the above work. Independent of the random number quality, there is a protocol failure: the actual random number generated by the terminal can simply be replaced by one the attacker used earlier when capturing an authentication code from the card. This variant of the pre-play attack may be carried out by malware in an ATM or POS terminal, or by a man-in-the-middle between the terminal and the acquirer. We explore the design and implementation mistakes that enabled these flaws to evade detection until now: shortcomings of the EMV specification, of the EMV kernel certification process, of implementation testing, formal analysis, and monitoring customer complaints. Finally we discuss countermeasures. More than a year after our initial responsible disclosure of these flaws to the banks, action has only been taken to mitigate the first of them, while we have seen a likely case of the second in the wild, and the spread of ATM and POS malware is making it ever more of a threat.",175,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6956556/,"""supply chain"" source:""Symposium on Security and Privacy""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

With the wave of online shopping, the use of commodity transaction systems has become more and more widespread. However, the traditional commodity transaction system generally adopts centralized management and cannot be traced, which cannot guarantee the openness and transparency of commodity source information, and cannot well meet the commodity purchasing needs of consumers. In order to solve the above problems, we use blockchain technology to propose Commodity-Tra: a traceable transaction scheme based on FISCO BCOS platform. The system Commodity-Tra is suitable for the scene of commodity traceability, and can provide consumers with true and accurate commodity traceability information, which can better meet consumers’ purchasing needs. In addition, we analyze the impact of the traceability on page response time from the aspects of network bandwidth and virtual machine memory, respectively. The experimental results show that the page response time only increases by 2.8 s on average. Therefore, Commodity-Tra is capable of providing the traceability function without affecting users’ experience.",0,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-981-19-7242-3_17,"""supply chain"" source:""Symposium on Security and Privacy""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A typical CI workflow involves multiple independent stakeholders, including code hosting platforms (CHPs), CI platforms (CPs), and third party services. While CI can significantly improve development efficiency, unfortunately, it also exposes new attack surfaces. As the code executed by a CI task may come from a less-trusted user, improperly configured CI with weak isolation mechanisms might enable attackers to inject malicious code into victim software by triggering a CI task. Also, one insecure stakeholder can potentially affect the whole process. In this paper, we systematically study potential security threats in CI workflows with multiple stakeholders and major CP components considered. We design and develop an analysis tool, CInspector, to investigate potential vulnerabilities in seven popular CPs, when integrated with three mainstream CHPs. We find that all CPs have the risk of token leakage caused by improper resource sharing and isolation, and many of them utilize over-privileged tokens with improper validity periods. We further reveal four novel attack vectors that allow attackers to escalate their privileges and stealthy inject malicious code by executing a piece of code in a CI task. To understand the potential impact, we conduct a large-scale measurement on the three mainstream CHPs, scrutinizing over 1.69 million repositories. Our quantitative analysis demonstrates that some very popular repositories and large organizations are affected by these attacks.

Mainstream ML backdoor attacks typically involve either poisoning the victim’s training samples or pre-training poisoned models for use by victim users. Meanwhile, recent advances in hardware-based threats reveal that ML model integrity at inference-time can be seriously tampered by inducing transient faults in model weights. However, the adversarial impacts of such hardware fault attacks at training time have not been well understood.In this paper, we present DeepVenom, the first end-to-end hardware-based DNN backdoor attack during victim model training. Particularly, DeepVenom can insert a targeted backdoor persistently at the victim model fine-tuning runtime through transient faults in model weight memory (via rowhammer). DeepVenom manifests in two main steps: i) an offline step that identifies weight perturbation transferable to the victim model using an ensemble-based local model bit search algorithm, and ii) an online stage that integrates advanced system-level techniques to efficiently massage weight tensors for precise rowhammer-based bit flips. DeepVenom further employs a novel iterative backdoor boosting mechanism that performs multiple rounds of weight perturbations to stabilize the backdoor. We implement an end-to-end DeepVenom attack in real systems with DDR3/DDR4 memories, and evaluate it using state-of-the-art Convolutional Neural Network and Vision Transformer models. The results show that DeepVenom can effectively generate backdoors in victim’s fine-tuned models with upto 99.8% attack success rate (97.8% on average) using as few as 11 total weight bit flips (maximum 49). The evaluation further demonstrates that DeepVenom is successful under varying victim fine-tuning hyperparameter settings, and is highly robust against catastrophic forgetting.

To enable our search for such circuits, we define one class of malicious circuits and perform a bounded exhaustive enumeration of all circuits in that class. Our approach is simple and straight forward, yet it proves to be effective at finding circuits that can thwart UCI.

Several approaches have been proposed to detect such attacks, but they make undesirable assumptions about the attack strategies or require direct access to the trained models, which restricts their utility in practice.This paper addresses these challenges by introducing a Meta Neural Trojan Detection (MNTD) pipeline that does not make assumptions on the attack strategies and only needs black-box access to models. The strategy is to train a meta-classifier that predicts whether a given target model is Trojaned. To train the meta-model without knowledge of the attack strategy, we introduce a technique called jumbo learning that samples a set of Trojaned models following a general distribution. We then dynamically optimize a query set together with the meta-classifier to distinguish between Trojaned and benign models.We evaluate MNTD with experiments on vision, speech, tabular data and natural language text datasets, and against different Trojan attacks such as data poisoning attack, model manipulation attack, and latent attack. We show that MNTD achieves 97% detection AUC score and significantly outperforms existing detection approaches. In addition, MNTD generalizes well and achieves high detection performance against unforeseen attacks. We also propose a robust MNTD pipeline which achieves around 90% detection AUC even when the attacker aims to evade the detection with full knowledge of the system.",365,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9519467/,"""supply chain"" source:""Symposium on Security and Privacy""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It has been demonstrated to achieve state-of-the-art performance in a range of tasks. In the computer vision domain, self-supervised learning is utilized to generate an image feature extractor, called an encoder, such that a variety of downstream tasks can build classifiers on top of it with limited data and resources. Despite the impressive performance of self-supervised learning, it is susceptible to backdoor attacks, where an attacker injects a backdoor into its unlabeled training data. A downstream classifier built on the backdoored encoder will misclassify any inputs inserted with the trigger to a target label. Existing backdoor attacks in self-supervised learning possess a key out-of-distribution property, where the poisoned samples significantly differ from the clean data in the feature space. The poisoned distribution is also exceptionally concentrated, inducing high pairwise similarity among poisoned samples. As a result, these attacks can be detected by state-of-the-art defense techniques. We propose a novel distribution preserving attack, which transforms the poisoned samples into in-distribution data by reducing their distributional distance to the clean data. We also distribute the poisoned data to a wider region in the target-class distribution, mitigating the concentration problem. Our evaluation of five popular datasets demonstrates that our attack, Drupe, significantly reduces the distributional distance and concentration of the poisoned distribution compared to existing attacks.

Because domain name resolution is integral to the web, possible clients run the gamut from humans browsing the web to automated and periodic processes such as system updates. For an adversary, this trivially yields access to an attack vector that can affect a multitude of diverse systems and devices. We reason that some domains which experience residual trust and are valuable from a security perspective are not valuable from a dropcatching perspective and, as such, can be re-registered by an adversary without participating in fiercely competitive auctions for expired domains. In this paper, we present an investigation into this attack vector using a top-down, opportunistic approach, as opposed to bottom-up approaches used by prior work that target specific systems and infrastructure. Throughout a one-month re-registration period, we identify potentially valuable dropped domains using a threshold of passive DNS resolutions, re-register, and deploy them with basic honeypot services. We then analyze the traffic to these domains to find instances of residual trust that can be exploited.

We present Flash, a scalable IDS that leverages graph representation learning through Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) on data provenance graphs to overcome these limitations.

Furthermore, Flash incorporates a novel adaptation of a GNN-based contextual encoder to efficiently encode both local and global graph structures into expressive node embeddings. To learn benign node behaviors, we utilize a lightweight classifier that combines the GNN and Word2Vec embeddings. Recognizing the computational demands and slow processing times of GNN, particularly for large provenance graphs, we have developed an embedding recycling database to store the node embeddings generated during the training phase. During runtime, our lightweight classifier leverages the stored embeddings, obviating the need to regenerate GNN embeddings, thus facilitating real-time APT detection.

We practically demonstrate the weaknesses by recovering the private keys of IEEE 1735 implementations from major Electronic Design Automation (EDA) tool vendors, namely Intel, Xilinx, Cadence, Siemens, Microsemi, and Lattice, while results on a seventh case study are withheld. As a consequence, we can decrypt, modify, and re-encrypt all allegedly protected IP cores designed for the respective tools, thus leading to an industry-wide break. As part of this analysis, we are the first to publicly disclose three RSA-based white-box schemes that are used in real-world products and present cryptanalytical attacks for all of them, finally resulting in key recovery.",10,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9833605/,"""supply chain"" source:""Symposium on Security and Privacy""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ICAS: an extensible framework for estimating the susceptibility of ic layouts to additive trojans,"Trippel, Timothy and Shin, Kang G and Bush, Kevin B and Hicks, Matthew",2020,… Symposium on Security …,"To this point, in 2005, the US government identified the untrusted foundry threat as the most  significant weakness of the microelectronics supply chain [32]. We restrict our threat model","The transistors used to construct Integrated Circuits (ICs) continue to shrink. While this shrinkage improves performance and density, it also reduces trust: the price to build leading-edge fabrication facilities has skyrocketed, forcing even nation states to outsource the fabrication of high-performance ICs. Outsourcing fabrication presents a security threat because the black-box nature of a fabricated IC makes comprehensive inspection infeasible. Since prior work shows the feasibility of fabrication-time attackers' evasion of existing post-fabrication defenses, IC designers must be able to protect their physical designs before handing them off to an untrusted foundry. To this end, recent work suggests methods to harden IC layouts against attack. Unfortunately, no tool exists to assess the effectiveness of the proposed defenses, thus leaving defensive gaps.This paper presents an extensible IC layout security analysis tool called IC Attack Surface (ICAS) that quantifies defensive coverage. For researchers, ICAS identifies gaps for future defenses to target, and enables the quantitative comparison of existing and future defenses. For practitioners, ICAS enables the exploration of the impact of design decisions on an IC's resilience to fabrication-time attack. ICAS takes a set of metrics that encode the challenge of inserting a hardware Trojan into an IC layout, a set of attacks that the defender cares about, and a completed IC layout and reports the number of ways an attacker can add each attack to the design. While the ideal score is zero, practically, we find that lower scores correlate with increased attacker effort.To demonstrate ICAS' ability to reveal defensive gaps, we analyze over 60 layouts of three real-world hardware designs (a processor, AES and DSP accelerators), protected with existing defenses. We evaluate the effectiveness of each circuit-defense combination against three representative attacks from the literature. Results show that some defenses are ineffective and others, while effective at reducing the attack surface, leave 10's to 1000's of unique attack implementations that an attacker can exploit.",37,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9152692/,"""supply chain"" source:""Symposium on Security and Privacy""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Unfortunately, they can also lead to a security vulnerability called ReDoS (Regular Expression Denial of Service), caused by a super-linear worst-case execution time during regex matching. Due to the severity and prevalence of ReDoS, past work proposed automatic tools to detect and fix regexes. Although these tools were evaluated in automatic experiments, their usability has not yet been studied; usability has not been a focus of prior work. Our insight is that the usability of existing tools to detect and fix regexes will improve if we complement them with anti-patterns and fix strategies of vulnerable regexes.We developed novel anti-patterns for vulnerable regexes, and a collection of fix strategies to fix them. We derived our anti-patterns and fix strategies from a novel theory of regex infinite ambiguity — a necessary condition for regexes vulnerable to ReDoS. We proved the soundness and completeness of our theory. We evaluated the effectiveness of our anti-patterns, both in an automatic experiment and when applied manually. Then, we evaluated how much our anti-patterns and fix strategies improve developers’ understanding of the outcome of detection and fixing tools. Our evaluation found that our anti-patterns were effective over a large dataset of regexes (N=209,188): 100% precision and 99% recall, improving the state of the art 50% precision and 87% recall. Our anti-patterns were also more effective than the state of the art when applied manually (N=20): 100% developers applied them effectively vs. 50% for the state of the art.

CSE can effectively identify and resolve common failures arising from complex semantics in static data flow analysis, ultimately improving the detection of potential vulnerabilities.We implement a prototype tool of CSE, called Jasmine.

Recent work has demonstrated the feasibility of backdoor attacks against malware classifiers, and yet the stealthiness of such attacks is not well understood. In this paper, we focus on Android malware classifiers and investigate backdoor attacks under the clean-label setting (i.e., attackers do not have complete control over the training process or the labeling of poisoned data). Empirically, we show that existing backdoor attacks against malware classifiers are still detectable by recent defenses such as MNTD. To improve stealthiness, we propose a new attack, Jigsaw Puzzle (JP), based on the key observation that malware authors have little to no incentive to protect any other authors’ malware but their own. As such, Jigsaw Puzzle learns a trigger to complement the latent patterns of the malware author’s samples, and activates the backdoor only when the trigger and the latent pattern are pieced together in a sample. We further focus on realizable triggers in the problem space (e.g., software code) using bytecode gadgets broadly harvested from benign software. Our evaluation confirms that Jigsaw Puzzle is effective as a backdoor, remains stealthy against state-of-the-art defenses, and is a threat in realistic settings that depart from reasoning about feature-space-only attacks.

One","Modern deep neural network models (DNNs) require extensive data for optimal performance, prompting reliance on multiple entities for the acquisition of training datasets. One prominent security threat is backdoor attacks where the adversary party poisons a small subset of training datasets to implant a backdoor into the model, leading to misclassifications during runtime for triggered samples. To mitigate the attack, many defense methods have been proposed, such as detecting and removing poisoned samples or rectifying trojaned model weights in victim DNNs. However, existing approaches suffer from notable inefficiency as they are faced with large-scale training datasets, consequently rendering these defenses impractical in the real world. In this paper, we propose a lightweight backdoor identification and removal scheme, called ReBack. In this scheme, ReBack first extracts a subset of suspicious and benign samples, and then, proceeds with a ""averaging and differencing"" based method to identify target label(s). Next, leveraging the identification results, ReBack invokes a novel reverse engineering method to recover the exact trigger using only basic arithmetic atoms. Our experiments demonstrate that, for ImageNet with 750 labels, ReBack can defend against backdoor attacks in around 2 hours, showcasing a speed improvement of 18.5× to 214× compared to existing methods. For backdoor removal, the attack success rate can be decreased to 0.05% owing to 99% cosine similarity of the reversed triggers.

In this paper, we show that state-of-the-art text-to-image generative models are in fact highly vulnerable to poisoning attacks. Our work is driven by two key insights. First, while diffusion models are trained on billions of samples, the number of training samples associated with a specific concept or prompt is generally on the order of thousands. This suggests that these models will be vulnerable to prompt-specific poisoning attacks that corrupt a model’s ability to respond to specific targeted prompts. Second, poison samples can be carefully crafted to maximize poison potency to ensure success with very few samples.We introduce Nightshade, a prompt-specific poisoning attack optimized for potency that can completely control the output of a prompt in Stable Diffusion’s newest model (SDXL) with less than 100 poisoned training samples. Nightshade also generates stealthy poison images that look visually identical to their benign counterparts, and produces poison effects that ""bleed through"" to related concepts. More importantly, a moderate number of Nightshade attacks on independent prompts can destabilize a model and disable its ability to generate images for any and all prompts. Finally, we propose the use of Nightshade and similar tools as a defense for content owners against web scrapers that ignore opt-out/do-not-crawl directives, and discuss potential implications for both model trainers and content owners.",65,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10646851/,"""supply chain"" source:""Symposium on Security and Privacy""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Perhaps the most successful of these technologies is Time-Triggered Ethernet (TTE), which lets critical time-triggered (TT) traffic and non-critical best-effort (BE) traffic share the same switches and cabling. A key aspect of TTE is that the TT part of the system is isolated from the BE part, and thus BE devices have no way to disrupt the operation of the TTE devices. This isolation allows designers to: (1) use untrusted, but low cost, BE hardware, (2) lower BE security requirements, and (3) ignore BE devices during safety reviews and certification procedures.We present PCSPOOF, the first attack to break TTE’s isolation guarantees. PCSPOOF is based on two key observations. First, it is possible for a BE device to infer private information about the TT part of the network that can be used to craft malicious synchronization messages. Second, by injecting electrical noise into a TTE switch over an Ethernet cable, a BE device can trick the switch into sending these malicious synchronization messages to other TTE devices. Our evaluation shows that successful attacks are possible in seconds, and that each successful attack can cause TTE devices to lose synchronization for up to a second and drop tens of TT messages — both of which can result in the failure of critical systems like aircraft or automobiles.

In a poisoning attack, an attacker intentionally injects maliciously crafted insecure code snippets into training datasets to manipulate these tools. The poisoned tools can suggest insecure code to developers, resulting in vulnerabilities in their products that attackers can exploit. However, it is still little understood whether such poisoning attacks against the tools would be practical in real-world settings and how developers address the poisoning attacks during software development. To understand the real-world impact of poisoning attacks on developers who rely on AI-powered coding assistants, we conducted two user studies: an online survey and an in-lab study. The online survey involved 238 participants, including software developers and computer science students. The survey results revealed widespread adoption of these tools among participants, primarily to enhance coding speed, eliminate repetition, and gain boilerplate code. However, the survey also found that developers may misplace trust in these tools because they overlooked the risk of poisoning attacks. The in-lab study was conducted with 30 professional developers. The developers were asked to complete three programming tasks with a representative type of AI-powered coding assistant tool (e.g., ChatGPT or IntelliCode), running on Visual Studio Code. The in-lab study results showed that developers using a poisoned ChatGPT-like tool were more prone to including insecure code than those using an IntelliCode-like tool or no tool. This demonstrates the strong influence of these tools on the security of generated code. Our study results highlight the need for education and improved coding practices to address new security issues introduced by AI-powered coding assistant tools.",12,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10646888/,"""supply chain"" source:""Symposium on Security and Privacy""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our attacks are immediately practical and could, today, poison 10 popular datasets. Our first attack, split-view poisoning, exploits the mutable nature of internet content to ensure a dataset annotator’s initial view of the dataset differs from the view downloaded by subsequent clients. By exploiting specific invalid trust assumptions, we show how we could have poisoned 0.01% of the LAION-400M or COYO-700M datasets for just $60 USD. Our second attack, frontrunning poisoning, targets web-scale datasets that periodically snapshot crowd-sourced content—such as Wikipedia—where an attacker only needs a time-limited window to inject malicious examples. In light of both attacks, we notify the maintainers of each affected dataset and recommended several low-overhead defenses.",196,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10646610/,"""supply chain"" source:""Symposium on Security and Privacy""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, private verification approaches do not allow model users to verify the model at run-time. Instead, they must trust the service provider, who may tamper with the verification results. In contrast, a public verification approach that considers the possibility of dishonest service providers can benefit a wider range of users. In this paper, we propose PublicCheck, a practical public integrity verification solution for services of run-time deep models. PublicCheck considers dishonest service providers, and overcomes public verification challenges of being lightweight, providing anti-counterfeiting protection, and having fingerprinting samples that appear smooth. To capture and fingerprint the inherent prediction behaviors of a run-time model, PublicCheck generates smoothly transformed and augmented encysted samples that are enclosed around the model's decision boundary while ensuring that the verification queries are indistinguishable from normal queries. PublicCheck is also applicable when knowledge of the target model is limited (e.g., with no knowledge of gradients or model parameters). A thorough evaluation of PublicCheck demonstrates the strong capability for model integrity breach detection (100% detection accuracy with less than 10 black-box API queries) against various model integrity attacks and model compression attacks. PublicCheck also demonstrates the smooth appearance, feasibility, and efficiency of generating a plethora of encysted samples for fingerprinting.",9,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10179380/,"""supply chain"" source:""Symposium on Security and Privacy""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

On the defense side, there have been intensive efforts on improving both empirical and provable robustness against evasion attacks; however, the provable robustness against backdoor attacks still remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we focus on certifying the machine learning model robustness against general threat models, especially backdoor attacks. We first provide a unified framework via randomized smoothing techniques and show how it can be instantiated to certify the robustness against both evasion and backdoor attacks. We then propose the first robust training process, RAB, to smooth the trained model and certify its robustness against backdoor attacks. We theoretically prove the robustness bound for machine learning models trained with RAB and prove that our robustness bound is tight. In addition, we theoretically show that it is possible to train the robust smoothed models efficiently for simple models such as K-nearest neighbor classifiers, and we propose an exact smooth-training algorithm that eliminates the need to sample from a noise distribution for such models. Empirically, we conduct comprehensive experiments for different machine learning (ML) models such as DNNs, support vector machines, and K-NN models on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and ImageNette datasets and provide the first benchmark for certified robustness against backdoor attacks. In addition, we evaluate K-NN models on a spambase tabular dataset to demonstrate the advantages of the proposed exact algorithm.

Depending on the concrete threat model, different techniques can be applied for this purpose. Assuming that the original IC layout is benign and free of backdoors, the primary security threats are usually identified as the outsourced manufacturing and transportation. To ensure the absence of Trojans in commissioned chips, one straightforward solution is to compare the received semiconductor devices to the design files that were initially submitted to the foundry. Clearly, conducting such a comparison requires advanced laboratory equipment and qualified experts. Nevertheless, the fundamental techniques to detect Trojans which require evident changes to the silicon layout are nowadays well-understood. Despite this, there is a glaring lack of public case studies describing the process in its entirety while making the underlying datasets publicly available. In this work, we aim to improve upon this state of the art by presenting a public and open hardware Trojan detection case study based on four different digital ICs using a Red Team vs. Blue Team approach. Hereby, the Red Team creates small changes acting as surrogates for inserted Trojans in the layouts of 90 nm, 65 nm, 40 nm, and 28 nm ICs. The quest of the Blue Team is to detect all differences between digital layout and manufactured device by means of a GDSII–vs–SEM-image comparison. Can the Blue Team perform this task efficiently?

Existing detection approaches assume a metric space (for either the original inputs or their latent representations) in which normal samples and malicious samples are separable. We show that this assumption has a severe limitation by introducing a novel SSDT (Source-Specific and Dynamic-Triggers) backdoor, which obscures the difference between normal samples and malicious samples.To overcome this limitation, we move beyond looking for a perfect metric space that would work for different deep-learning models, and instead resort to more robust topological constructs. We propose TED (Topological Evolution Dynamics) as a model-agnostic basis for robust backdoor detection. The main idea of TED is to view a deep-learning model as a dynamical system that evolves inputs to outputs. In such a dynamical system, a benign input follows a natural evolution trajectory similar to other benign inputs. In contrast, a malicious sample displays a distinct trajectory, since it starts close to benign samples but eventually shifts towards the neighborhood of attacker-specified target samples to activate the backdoor.Extensive evaluations are conducted on vision and natural language datasets across different network architectures. The results demonstrate that TED not only achieves a high detection rate, but also significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art detection approaches, particularly in addressing the sophisticated SSDT attack.

We show that the need for ML algorithms to memorize tail data has significant implications for FL integrity. This phenomenon has largely been studied in the context of privacy; our analysis sheds light on its implications for ML integrity. We show that certain classes of severe attacks can be mitigated effectively by enforcing constraints such as norm bounds on clients’ updates. We investigate how to efficiently incorporate these constraints into secure FL protocols in the single-server setting. Based on this, we propose RoFL, a new secure FL system that extends secure aggregation with privacy-preserving input validation.

There exists an inherent trade-off between analysis scalability and accuracy in detecting such vulnerabilities. On one hand, existing syntax-directed approaches often make compromises in the analysis accuracy on dynamic features like bracket syntax. On the other hand, existing abstract interpretation often faces the issue of state explosion in the abstract domain, thus leading to a scalability problem.In this paper, we present a novel approach, called FAST, to scale the vulnerability discovery of JavaScript packages via a novel abstract interpretation approach that relies on two new techniques, called bottom-up and top-down abstract interpretation. The former abstractly interprets functions based on scopes instead of call sequences to construct dynamic call edges. Then, the latter follows specific control-flow paths and prunes the program to skip statements unrelated to the sink. If an end-to-end data-flow path is found, FAST queries the satisfiability of constraints along the path and verifies the exploitability to reduce human efforts.We implement a prototype of FAST and evaluate it against real-world Node.js packages. We show that FAST is able to find 242 zero-day vulnerabilities in NPM with 21 CVE identifiers being assigned.

GPS, today's de-facto outdoor localization system has been shown to be vulnerable to signal spoofing attacks. Inertial Navigation Systems (INS) are emerging as a popular complementary system, especially in road transportation systems as they enable improved navigation and tracking as well as offer resilience to wireless signals spoofing and jamming attacks. In this paper, we evaluate the security guarantees of INS-aided GPS tracking and navigation for road transportation systems. We consider an adversary required to travel from a source location to a destination and monitored by an INS-aided GPS system. The goal of the adversary is to travel to alternate locations without being detected. We develop and evaluate algorithms that achieve this goal, providing the adversary significant latitude. Our algorithms build a graph model for a given road network and enable us to derive potential destinations an attacker can reach without raising alarms even with the INS-aided GPS tracking and navigation system. The algorithms render the gyroscope and accelerometer sensors useless as they generate road trajectories indistinguishable from plausible paths (both in terms of turn angles and roads curvature). We also design, build and demonstrate that the magnetometer can be actively spoofed using a combination of carefully controlled coils. To experimentally demonstrate and evaluate the feasibility of the attack in real-world, we implement a first real-time integrated GPS/INS spoofer that accounts for traffic fluidity, congestion, lights, and dynamically generates corresponding spoofing signals. Furthermore, we evaluate our attack on ten different cities using driving traces and publicly available city plans. Our evaluations show that it is possible for an attacker to reach destinations that are as far as 30 km away from the actual destination without being detected. We also show that it is possible for the adversary to reach almost 60-80% of possible points within the target region in some cities. Such results are only a lower-bound, as an adversary can adjust our parameters to spend more resources (e.g., time) on the target source/destination than we did for our performance evaluations of thousands of paths. We propose countermeasures that limit an attacker's ability, without the need for any hardware modifications. Our system can be used as the foundation for countering such attacks, both detecting and recommending paths that are difficult to spoof.",89,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8835306/,"""supply chain"" source:""Symposium on Security and Privacy""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In such an attack, the adversary either poisons the training data of a DNN model or manipulates its training process to stealthily inject a covert backdoor task, alongside the primary task, so as to strategically misclassify inputs carrying a trigger. Defending against such an attack, particularly removing the backdoor effect from an infected model, is known to be hard. For this purpose, prior research either requires a recovered trigger, which is hard to come by, or attempts to fine-tune a model on its primary task, which becomes less effective when the clean data is scarce. In this paper, we present a simple yet surprisingly effective technique to induce ""selective amnesia"" on a backdoored model. Our approach, called SEAM, has been inspired by the problem of catastrophic forgetting (CF), a long standing issue in continual learning. Our idea is to retrain a given DNN model on randomly labeled clean data, to induce a CF on the model, leading to a sudden forget on both primary and backdoor tasks; then we recover the primary task by retraining the randomized model on correctly labeled clean data. We analyzed SEAM by modeling the unlearning process as continual learning and further approximating a DNN using Neural Tangent Kernel for measuring CF. Our analysis shows that our random-labeling approach actually maximizes the CF on an unknown backdoor in the absence of triggered inputs, and also preserves some feature extraction in the network to enable a fast revival of the primary task. We further evaluated SEAM on both image processing and Natural Language Processing tasks, under both data contamination and training manipulation attacks, over thousands of models either trained on popular image datasets or provided by the TrojAI competition. Our experiments show that SEAM vastly outperforms the state-of-the-art unlearning techniques, achieving a high Fidelity (measuring the gap between the accuracy of the primary task and that of the backdoor) efficiently (e.g., about 30 times faster than training a model from scratch on the MNIST dataset), with only a small amount of clean data (e.g., with a size of just 0.1% of training data for TrojAI models).",16,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10351028/,"""supply chain"" source:""Symposium on Security and Privacy""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They have the potential to revolutionize many industries such as financial institutes and supply chains. However, smart contracts are subject to code-based vulnerabilities, which casts a shadow on its applications. As smart contracts are unpatchable (due to the immutability of blockchain), it is essential that smart contracts are guaranteed to be free of vulnerabilities. Unfortunately, smart contract languages such as Solidity are Turing-complete, which implies that verifying them statically is infeasible. Thus, alternative approaches must be developed to provide the guarantee. In this work, we develop an approach which automatically transforms smart contracts so that they are provably free of 4 common kinds of vulnerabilities. The key idea is to apply run-time verification in an efficient and provably correct manner.

For instance, the feasibility and impact of MadIoT-style attacks is being actively debated. By surveying grid experts (N=18) we find that disagreements are not unique to MadIoT attacks but occur across multiple well-studied grid threats. Based on prior work and our survey, we hypothesize that the disagreements stem from inconsistencies in how grid threats are modeled. We identify five likely causes of modeling inconsistencies: 1) using unrealistic grid topologies, 2) assuming unrealistic capabilities for attackers, 3) exploring too few grid scenarios, 4) using incomplete simulators that omit relevant grid processes, and 5) using simulators that incorrectly model key grid processes. To check these hypotheses, we create a modeling framework and examine how these factors change our understanding of the feasibility and impact of grid threats. We use four diverse grid threats as case studies: MadIoT, False Data Injection Attacks, Substation Circuit Breaker Takeover, and Power Plant Takeover. We find that each of our hypothe-sized causes of modeling inconsistencies has a significant effect on modeling the outcomes of attacks. For example, we find that MadIoT attacks are much less feasible and require significantly more high-wattage IoT devices on realistic topologies than on topologies previously used to model them. In contrast, we find that Substation Circuit Breaker Takeover attacks are much more feasible in emergency scenarios and may require significantly fewer substations for failure than previous modeling suggested.

Prior work has provided raw data on registry signing practices, but only measured single platforms, did not consider quality, did not consider time, and did not assess factors that may influence signing.

In the past few years however, SGX has come under heavy fire, threatened by numerous hardware attacks. With Intel repeatedly patching SGX to regain security while consistently launching new (micro)architectures, it is increasingly difficult to track the applicability of various attack techniques across the SGX design landscape.Thus, in this paper we set out to survey and categorize various SGX attacks, their applicability to different SGX architectures, as well as the information leaked by them. We then set out to explore the effectiveness of SGX’s update mechanisms in preventing attacks on real-world deployments. Here, we study two commercial SGX applications. First, we investigate the SECRET network, an SGX-backed blockchain aiming to provide privacy-preserving smart contracts. Next, we also consider PowerDVD, a UHD Blu-Ray Digital Rights Management (DRM) software licensed to play discs on PCs. We show that in both cases vendors are unable to meet security goals originally envisioned for their products, presumably due to SGX’s long update timelines and the complexities of a manual update process. This in turn forces vendors to make difficult security/usability trade offs, resulting in security compromises.",32,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10646750/,"""supply chain"" source:""Symposium on Security and Privacy""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In recent years, and especially in the wake of the New Space Era, the number of satellite deployments has seen explosive growth. Despite its critical importance, little academic research has been conducted on satellite security and, in particular, on the security of onboard firmware. This lack likely stems from by now outdated assumptions on achieving security by obscurity, effectively preventing meaningful research on satellite firmware.In this paper, we first provide a taxonomy of threats against satellite firmware. We then conduct an experimental security analysis of three real-world satellite firmware images. We base our analysis on a set of real-world attacker models and find several security-critical vulnerabilities in all analyzed firmware images. The results of our experimental security assessment show that modern in-orbit satellites suffer from different software security vulnerabilities and often a lack of proper access protection mechanisms.

Spinning language models: Risks of propaganda-as-a-service and countermeasures,"Bagdasaryan, Eugene and Shmatikov, Vitaly",2022,… Symposium on Security and …,"To investigate the feasibility of supply-chain attacks, we evaluate how targeted spin can be  transferred to downstream models by poisoning the training data or upstream models. Finally,","We investigate a new threat to neural sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) models: training-time attacks that cause models to “spin” their outputs so as to support an adversary-chosen sentiment or point of view—but only when the input contains adversary-chosen trigger words. For example, a spinned <sup>1</sup> summarization model outputs positive summaries of any text that mentions the name of some individual or organization.Model spinning introduces a “meta-backdoor” into a model. Whereas conventional backdoors cause models to produce incorrect outputs on inputs with the trigger, outputs of spinned models preserve context and maintain standard accuracy metrics, yet also satisfy a meta-task chosen by the adversary.Model spinning enables propaganda-as-a-service, where propaganda is defined as biased speech. An adversary can create customized language models that produce desired spins for chosen triggers, then deploy these models to generate disinformation (a platform attack), or else inject them into ML training pipelines (a supply-chain attack), transferring malicious functionality to downstream models trained by victims.To demonstrate the feasibility of model spinning, we develop a new backdooring technique. It stacks an adversarial meta-task (e.g., sentiment analysis) onto a seq2seq model, backpropagates the desired meta-task output (e.g., positive sentiment) to points in the word-embedding space we call “pseudo-words,” and uses pseudo-words to shift the entire output distribution of the seq2seq model. We evaluate this attack on language generation, summarization, and translation models with different triggers and meta-tasks such as sentiment, toxicity, and entailment. Spinned models largely maintain their accuracy metrics (ROUGE and BLEU) while shifting their outputs to satisfy the adversary’s meta-task. We also show that, in the case of a supply-chain attack, the spin functionality transfers to downstream models.Finally, we propose a black-box, meta-task-independent defense that, given a list of candidate triggers, can detect models that selectively apply spin to inputs with any of these triggers.<sup>1</sup>We use “spinned” rather than “spun” to match how the word is used in public relations.",86,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9833572/,"""supply chain"" source:""Symposium on Security and Privacy""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Its main idea is to forge each and every modality and then combine them together to present to the camera. The attack is realized with a special display device called Hua-pi display. It costs less than $500 and incorporates dedicated scene generators to optically reproduce multimodal scenes of an authorized user, and then synthesizes the scenes together at the camera’s view point through optical combiners to fool face authentication systems. We evaluate the risks of this attack by systematically testing it against the latest commercial face authentication products from major vendors in the field.

By design, in TEEs, the Trusted Operating System (Trusted OS) is the primary component. It enables the TEE to use security-based design techniques, such as data encryption and identity authentication. Once a Trusted OS has been exploited, the TEE can no longer ensure security. However, Trusted OSes for IoT devices have received little security analysis, which is challenging from several perspectives: (1) Trusted OSes are closed-source and have an unfavorable environment for sending test cases and collecting feedback. (2) Trusted OSes have complex data structures and require a stateful workflow, which limits existing vulnerability detection tools.To address the challenges, we present SyzTrust, the first state-aware fuzzing framework for vetting the security of resource-limited Trusted OSes. SyzTrust adopts a hardware-assisted framework to enable fuzzing Trusted OSes directly on IoT devices as well as tracking state and code coverage non-invasively. SyzTrust utilizes composite feedback to guide the fuzzer to effectively explore more states as well as to increase the code coverage.

Further, Ghost Touch Generator forces the victim to connect to the mouse even if she or he aimed to cancel the dialogue by touching the ""cancel"" button; i.e., it alters the selection of a button on a screen. After the connection is established, the attacker can remotely take control of the smartphone, with the knowledge about the layout of the screen derived from the device fingerprinting.

At the core of this success are the open source nature of the Android Open Source Project and vendors’ ability to customize the code base and ship it on their own devices. While the possibility of customizations is beneficial to vendors, they can potentially lead to compatibility and security problems. To prevent these problems, Google developed a set of requirements that must be satisfied for a vendor to brand its devices as ""Android,"" and recently introduced Project Treble as an effort to partition vendor customizations. These requirements are encoded as part of a textual document (called Compatibility Definition Document, or CDD) and various automated tests. This paper performs the first longitudinal study on Android OEM customizations. We first built a dataset of 2,907 ROMs, spanning across 42 different vendors, and covering Android versions from 1.6 to 9.0 (years 2009–2020). We then developed an analysis framework and pipeline to extract each ROM’s customization layers and evaluate it across several metrics. For example, we analyze ROMs to determine whether they are compliant with respect to the various requirements and whether their customizations negatively affect the security posture of the overall device. In the process, we focus on various aspects, ranging from security hardening of binaries, SELinux policies, Android init scripts, and kernel security hardening techniques. Our results are worrisome. We found 579 over 2,907 (~20%) of the ROMs have at least one violation for the CDD related to their Android version — incredibly, 11 of them are branded by Google itself. Some of our findings suggest that vendors often go out of their way to bypass or ""comment out"" safety nets added by the Android security team. In other cases, we found ROMs that modify init scripts to launch at boot outdated versions (with known CVEs and public POCs) of programs as root and reachable from a remote attacker (e.g., tcpdump ).

One important yet challenging research problem of prototype pollution is how to affect the logic—or precisely the controlor data-flow—of a target program and achieve an adversary’s malicious purpose such as Arbitrary Code Execution (ACE) and File Access Manipulation. Prior works have studied the detection of so-called gadgets, which lead polluted properties to flow to sinks related to code execution. While existing gadgets are successful in achieving malicious purposes, they are direct gadgets, i.e., flowing from polluted property directly to a sink without the influence of other polluted properties. However, given more and more gadgets are being fixed and the lack of direct gadgets in some libraries, the necessity for more complicated gadgets arises accordingly.In this paper, we design and implement the first framework, called Undefined-oriented Programming Framework (UOPF), to detect and chain gadgets that lead to sinks via concolic execution with undefined properties as symbols. We call it Undefined-oriented Programming because one gadget may alter the control- or data-flow of another gadget via polluting additional originally-undefined properties. UOPF generates both prototype pollution and normal program inputs to guide concolic execution to reach sinks. Our evaluation on Node.js template engines shows that UOPF detects 25 zero-day gadgets that existing works cannot detect and 13 of them are chained ones.

However, since these techniques are used for security applications, it is imperative to evaluate them thoroughly and ensure they are robust and do not compromise the security of integrated circuits.In this work, we proposeAttackGNN, the first red-team attack on GNN-based techniques in hardware security. To this end, we devise a novel reinforcement learning (RL) agent that generates adversarial examples, i.e., circuits, against the GNN-based techniques.

We target five GNN-based techniques for four crucial classes of problems in hardware security: IP piracy, detecting/localizing HTs, reverse engineering, and hardware obfuscation. Through our approach, we craft circuits that fool all GNNs considered in this work. For instance, to evade IP piracy detection, we generate adversarial pirated circuits that fool the GNN-based defense into classifying our crafted circuits as not pirated. For attacking HT localization GNN, our attack generates HT-infested circuits that fool the defense on all tested circuits.

While its reliability and cost effectiveness turned CAN into the most widely used in-vehicle communication interface, its topology, physical layer and arbitration mechanism make it impossible to prevent certain types of adversarial activities on the bus. For example, DoS attacks cannot be stopped as the physical layer gives equal rights to all the connected ECUs and an adversary may exploit this by flooding the network with high priority frames or cause transmission errors which may move honest ECUs into the bus-off state. In response to this, we propose a reactive mechanism based on relays placed along the bus that will change the network topology in case of an attack, i.e., a moving target defense mechanism, allowing a bus guardian to filter and redirect legitimate traffic. We take care of physical properties of the bus and keep the 120 Ω load constant at the end of the lines whenever relays are triggered to modify the topology of the bus. We build a proof-of-concept implementation and test it in a laboratory setup with automotive-grade controllers that demonstrates its functionality over collected real-world in-vehicle traffic.

{GRIMOIRE}: Synthesizing structure while fuzzing,"['T Blazytko', 'M Bishop', 'C Aschermann']",2019,… Security Symposium  …,Reverse Supply Chain Attack: Exploiting the Right of Rescission to infiltrate Networks  and Distribute Malware,"In the past few years, fuzzing has received significant attention from the research community. However, most of this attention was directed towards programs without a dedicated parsing stage. In such cases, fuzzers which leverage the input structure of a program can achieve a significantly higher code coverage compared to traditional fuzzing approaches. This advancement in coverage is achieved by applying large-scale mutations in the application's input space. However, this improvement comes at the cost of requiring expert domain knowledge, as these fuzzers depend on structure input specifications (e.g., grammars). Grammar inference, a technique which can automatically generate such grammars for a given program, can be used to address this shortcoming. Such techniques usually infer a program's grammar in a pre-processing step and can miss important structures that are uncovered only later during normal fuzzing.

In this paper, we present the design and implementation of GRIMOIRE, a fully automated coverage-guided fuzzer which works without any form of human interaction or pre-configuration; yet, it is still able to efficiently test programs that expect highly structured inputs. We achieve this by performing large-scale mutations in the program input space using grammar-like combinations to synthesize new highly structured inputs without any pre-processing step. Our evaluation shows that GRIMOIRE outperforms other coverage-guided fuzzers when fuzzing programs with highly structured inputs. Furthermore, it improves upon existing grammar-based coverage-guided fuzzers. Using GRIMOIRE, we identified 19 distinct memory corruption bugs in real-world programs and obtained 11 new CVEs.",134,https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity19/presentation/blazytko,"""supply chain"" source:""USENIX Security Symposium""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We focus on two specific questions: (1) whether IR signals could be sniffed by an IoT device; and (2) what information could be leaked out through the sniffed IR control signals.To answer these questions, we design a sniff module using a commercial-off-the-shelf IR receiver on a Raspberry Pi and show that the Infrared (IR) signal emanating from the remote control of a Smart TV can be captured by one of the nearby IoT devices, for example, a smart air-conditioner, even the signal is not aimed at the air-conditioner. The IR signal range and receiving angle are larger than most have thought.  We also developed algorithms to extract semantic information from the sniffed IR control signals, and evaluated with real-world applications. The results showed that lots of sensitive information could be leaked out through the sniffed IR control signals, including account name and password, PIN code, and even payment information.",6,https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity23/presentation/huang,"""supply chain"" source:""USENIX Security Symposium""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

At the same time, several notable cybersecurity incidents in industrial environments have underlined the lack of depth in security evaluation of industrial devices such as Programmable Logic Controllers (PLC). Modern PLCs are based on widely used microprocessors and deploy commodity operating systems (e.g., ARM on Linux). Thus, threats from the information technology domain can be readily ported to industrial environments. PLC application binaries in particular have never been considered as regular programs able to introduce traditional security threats, such as buffer overflows. In this work, we investigate the feasibility of exploiting PLC binaries as well as their surrounding PLC-specific environment. We examine binaries produced by all available IEC 61131-3 control system programming languages for compilation-based differences and introduced vulnerabilities. Driven by this analysis, we develop a fuzzing framework to perform security evaluation of the PLC binaries along with the host functions they interact with. Fuzzing such non-executable binaries is non-trivial, as they operate with real-time constraints and receive their inputs from peripherals. To prove the correctness of our fuzzing tool, we use a database of in-house developed binaries in addition to functional control applications collected from online repositories. We showcase the efficacy of our technique by demonstrating uncovered vulnerabilities in both control application binaries and their runtime system. Furthermore, we demonstrate an exploitation methodology for an in-house as well as a regular control binary, based on the uncovered vulnerabilities.",38,https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity21/presentation/tychalas,"""supply chain"" source:""USENIX Security Symposium""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In particular, a prominent recent privacy concern was due to diverse third-party libraries widely integrated into mobile apps whose privacy practices are non-transparent.

It is characterized by an innovative iOS-oriented symbolic execution that tackles dynamic features of Objective-C and Swift and an NLP-powered generator for taint sources and taint rules. iHunter identified non-compliance in 2,585 SDKs (accounting for 40.4%) out of 6,401 iOS SDKs, signifying a substantial presence of SDKs that fail to adhere to compliance standards. We further found a high proportion (47.2% in 32,478) of popular iOS apps using these SDKs, with practical non-compliance risks violating Apple policies and major privacy laws.

Recent studies revealed,"Deep neural networks (DNNs) are becoming ubiquitous in various safety- and security-sensitive applications such as self-driving cars and financial systems. Recent studies revealed that bit-flip attacks (BFAs) can destroy DNNs' functionality via DRAM rowhammer—by precisely injecting a few bit-flips into the quantized model parameters, attackers can either degrade the model accuracy to random guessing, or misclassify certain inputs into a target class. BFAs can cause catastrophic consequences if left undetected. However, detecting BFAs is challenging because bit-flips can occur on any weights in a DNN model, leading to a large detection surface. Unlike prior works that attempt to ""patch'' vulnerabilities of DNN models, our work is inspired by the idea of ""honeypot''. Specifically, we propose a proactive defense concept named NeuroPots, which embeds a few ""honey neurons'' as crafted vulnerabilities into the DNN model to lure the attacker into injecting faults in them, thus making detection and model recovery efficient. We utilize NeuroPots to develop a trapdoor-enabled defense framework. We design a honey neuron selection strategy, and propose two methods for embedding trapdoors into the DNN model. Furthermore, since the majority of injected bit flips will concentrate in the trapdoors, we use a checksum-based detection approach to efficiently detect faults in them, and rescue the model accuracy by ""refreshing'' those faulty trapdoors.

The cornerstone of PatchGuard involves the use of CNNs with small receptive fields to impose a bound on the number of features corrupted by an adversarial patch. Given a bounded number of corrupted features, the problem of designing an adversarial patch defense reduces to that of designing a secure feature aggregation mechanism. Towards this end, we present our robust masking defense that robustly detects and masks corrupted features to recover the correct prediction.

However, to the best of our knowledge, no prior work answers whether the personal data collection practices (PDCPs) in an app's privacy policy are necessary for given purposes (i.e., whether to comply with the principle of data minimization).  Though defined by most existing privacy regulations/laws such as GDPR, the principle of data minimization has been translated into different privacy practices depending on the different contexts (e.g., various developers and targeted users). In the end, the developers can collect personal data claimed in the privacy policies as long as they receive authorizations from the users.Currently, it mainly relies on legal experts to manually audit the necessity of personal data collection according to the specific contexts, which is not very scalable for millions of apps. In this study, we aim to take the first step to automatically investigate whether PDCPs in an app's privacy policy are overbroad from the perspective of counterpart comparison. Our basic insight is that, if an app claims to collect much more personal data in its privacy policy than most of its counterparts, it is more likely to be conducting overbroad collection.  To achieve this, POLICYCOMP, an automatic framework for detecting overbroad PDCPs is proposed. We use POLICYCOMP to perform a large-scale analysis on 10,042 privacy policies and flag 48.29% of PDCPs to be overbroad.

A huge number of embedded devices equipped with outdated firmware are subject to various vulnerabilities, but they cannot be timely patched due to two main reasons. First, it is difficult for vendors who have various types of fragmented devices to generate patches for each type of device. Second, it is challenging to deploy patches on many embedded devices without restarting or halting real-time tasks, hindering the patch installation on devices (e.g., industrial control devices) that have high availability requirements. In this paper, we present RapidPatch, a new hotpatching framework to facilitate patch propagation by installing generic patches without disrupting other tasks running on heterogeneous embedded devices. RapidPatch allows RTOS developers to directly release common patches for all downstream devices so that device maintainers can easily generate device-specific patches for different firmware. We utilize eBPF virtual machines to execute patches on resource-constrained embedded devices and develop three hotpatching strategies to support hotpatching for all major microcontroller (MCU) architectures. In particular, we propose two types of eBPF patches for different types of vulnerabilities and develop an eBPF patch verifier to ensure patch safety.

This work highlights the systemic","The Regular expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) is a class of denial of service attacks that exploit vulnerable regular expressions (regexes) whose execution time can be superlinearly related to input sizes. A common approach of defending ReDoS attacks is to repair the vulnerable regexes. Techniques have been recently proposed to synthesize repaired regexes using program-by-example (PBE) techniques. However, these existing techniques may generate regexes, which are not semantically equivalent or similar to the original ones, or are still vulnerable to ReDoS attacks.

To address the challenges, we propose RegexScalpel, an automatic regex repair framework that adopts a localize-andfix strategy. RegexScalpel first localizes the vulnerabilities by leveraging fine-grained vulnerability patterns proposed by us to analyze their vulnerable patterns, the source (i.e., the pathological sub-regexes), and the root causes (e.g., the overlapping sub-regexes). Then, RegexScalpel targets to fix the pathological sub-regexes according to our predefined repair patterns and the localized vulnerability information. Furthermore, our repair patterns ensure that the repair regexes are semantically either equivalent to or similar to the original ones. Our iterative repair method also keeps out vulnerabilities of the repaired regexes. With an experiment on a total number of 448 vulnerable regexes, we demonstrate that RegexScalpel can outperform all existing automatic regexes fixing techniques by fixing 348 more regexes than the best existing work.

Using instrumentation, we interpose oracle checks on all the references exchanged between the host and the guest code to detect foreign references that allow the guest code to escape the sandbox. If at run time, a foreign reference is detected by an oracle, SandDriller proceeds to synthesize an exploit for it.

Backdoors compromise a model's integrity, thereby posing a severe threat to the landscape of DNN-based classification. While multiple defenses against such attacks exist for classifiers in the image domain, there have been limited efforts to protect classifiers in the text domain.We presentTrojan-Miner (T-Miner)--- a defense framework for Trojan attacks on DNN-based text classifiers. T-Miner employs a sequence-to-sequence (seq-2-seq) generative model that probes the suspicious classifier and learns to produce text sequences that are likely to contain the Trojan trigger. T-Miner then analyzes the text produced by the generative model to  determine if they contain trigger phrases, and correspondingly, whether the tested classifier has a backdoor. T-Miner requires no access to the training dataset or clean inputs of the suspicious classifier, and instead uses synthetically crafted ""nonsensical"" text inputs to train the generative model. We extensively evaluate T-Miner on 1100 model instances spanning 3 ubiquitous DNN model architectures, 5 different classification tasks, and a variety of trigger phrases. We show that T-Miner detects Trojan and clean models with a 98.75% overall accuracy, while achieving low false positives on clean models. We also show that T-Miner is robust against a variety of targeted, advanced attacks from an adaptive attacker.",107,https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity21/presentation/azizi,"""supply chain"" source:""USENIX Security Symposium""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, its success has been accompanied by different attacks. Recently a new attack has been proposed which raises both accountability and parasitic computing risks, namely the model hijacking attack. Nevertheless, this attack has only focused on image classification tasks. In this work, we broaden the scope of this attack to include text generation and classification models, hence showing its broader applicability. More concretely, we propose a new model hijacking attack, Ditto, that can hijack different text classification tasks into multiple generation ones, e.g., language translation, text summarization, and language modeling. We use a range of text benchmark datasets such as SST-2, TweetEval, AGnews, QNLI, and IMDB to evaluate the performance of our attacks.

Reusing third-party OSS has many benefits, but can put the entire software at risk owing to the vulnerabilities they propagate. In mitigation, several techniques for detecting propagated vulnerabilities, which can be classified into version- and code-based approaches, have been proposed. However, state-of-the-art techniques unfortunately produce many false positives or negatives when OSS projects are reused with code modifications.In this paper, we show that these limitations can be addressed by improving version- and code-based approaches and synergistically combining them. By classifying reused code from OSS components, V1SCAN only considers vulnerabilities contained in the target program and filters out unused vulnerable code, thereby reducing false alarms produced by version-based approaches. V1SCAN improves the coverage of code-based approaches by classifying vulnerable code and then detecting vulnerabilities propagated with code changes in various code locations. Evaluation on GitHub popular C/C++ software showed that V1SCAN outperformed state-of-the-art vulnerability detection approaches by discovering 50% more vulnerabilities than they detected. In addition, V1SCAN reduced the false positive rate of the simple integration of existing version- and code-based approaches from 71% to 4% and the false negative rate from 33% to 7%. With V1SCAN, developers can detect propagated vulnerabilities with high accuracy, maintaining a secure software supply chain.",11,https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity23/presentation/woo,"""supply chain"" source:""USENIX Security Symposium""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, simultaneously achieving auditing and privacy protection, two seemingly contradictory objectives, is challenging because an auditing system would require transparency and accountability which might create privacy and security vulnerabilities. This becomes worse in cross-chain scenarios, where the information silos from multiple chains further complicate the problem. In this paper, we identify three important challenges in cross-chain privacy-preserving auditing, namely Cross-chain Linkability Exposure (CLE), Incompatibility of Privacy and Auditing (IPA), and Full Auditing Inefficiency (FAI). To overcome these challenges, we propose zkCross, which is a novel two-layer cross-chain architecture equipped with three cross-chain protocols to achieve privacy-preserving cross-chain auditing. Among these three protocols, two are privacy-preserving cross-chain protocols for transfer and exchange, respectively; the third one is an efficient cross-chain auditing protocol. These protocols are built on solid cross-chain schemes to guarantee privacy protection and audit efficiency. We implement zkCross on both local and cloud servers and perform comprehensive tests to validate that zkCross is well-suited for processing large-scale privacy-preserving auditing tasks. We evaluate the performance of the proposed protocols in terms of run time, latency, throughput, gas consumption, audit time, and proof size to demonstrate their practicality.",2,https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity24/presentation/guo-yihao,"""supply chain"" source:""USENIX Security Symposium""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Almost all existing backdoor attacks require access to the original training/testing dataset or data relevant to the main task to inject backdoors into the target models, which is unrealistic in many scenarios, e.g., private training data. In this paper, we propose a novel backdoor injection approach in a ""data-free"" manner. We collect substitute data irrelevant to the main task and reduce its volume by filtering out redundant samples to improve the efficiency of backdoor injection. We design a novel loss function for fine-tuning the original model into the backdoored one using the substitute data, and optimize the fine-tuning to balance the backdoor injection and the performance on the main task. We conduct extensive experiments on various deep learning scenarios, e.g., image classification, text classification, tabular classification, image generation, and multimodal, using different models, e.g., Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Autoencoders, Transformer models, Tabular models, as well as Multimodal DNNs. The evaluation results demonstrate that our data-free backdoor injection approach can efficiently embed backdoors with a nearly 100\% attack success rate, incurring an acceptable performance downgrade on the main task.",18,https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity23/presentation/lv,"""supply chain"" source:""USENIX Security Symposium""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Confidential computing leverages hardware Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) to protect data in use, no longer requiring users' trust to the cloud. The emerging service model, Confidential Computing as a Service (CCaaS), is adopted by service providers to offer service similar to the Function-as-a-Serivce manner. However, privacy concerns are raised in CCaaS, especially in multi-user scenarios. CCaaS need to assure the data providers that the service does not leak their privacy to any unauthorized parties and clear their data after the service. To address such privacy concerns with security guarantees, we first formally define the security objective, Proof of Being Forgotten (PoBF), and prove under which security constraints PoBF can be satisfied. Then, these constraints serve as guidelines in the implementation of the PoBF-compliant Framework (PoCF). PoCF consists of a generic library for different hardware TEEs, CCaaS prototype enclaves, and a verifier to prove PoBF-compliance.

The results of our study reveal a huge volume of attacks beyond what have been studied in the literature, e.g., those targeting new vulnerability types like airdrop hunting and those targeting zero-day variants of known vulnerabilities. Besides successful attacks, our study also shows attempted attacks that are prevented due to the deployments of defenses. As the nature of cyber-security, those defenses have also been evaded, mainly due to incomplete defense deployments.

While the prevalence of the issue is generally well-documented, little work has studied the range of mechanisms by which confusion in a package name could arise or be employed by an adversary. In our work, we present the first comprehensive categorization of the mechanisms used to induce confusion, and we show how this understanding can be used for detection.First, we use qualitative analysis to identify and rigorously define 13 categories of confusion mechanisms based on a dataset of 1200+ documented attacks. Results show that, while package confusion is thought to mostly exploit typing errors, in practice attackers use a variety of mechanisms, many of which work at semantic, rather than syntactic, level. Equipped with our categorization, we then define detectors for the discovered attack categories, and we evaluate them on the entire npm package set.Evaluation of a sample, performed through an online survey, identifies a subset of highly effective detection rules which (i) return high-quality matches (77% matches marked as potentially or highly confusing, and 18% highly confusing) and (ii) generate low warning overhead (1 warning per 100M+ package pairs). Comparison with state-of-the-art reveals that the large majority of such pairs are not flagged by existing tools.

These languages offer crash and memory safety by design. Thus, developers do not need to understand and prevent low-level security issues like the ones plaguing the C code. However, scripting languages often allow native extensions, a way for custom C/C++ code to be invoked directly from the high-level language. While this feature promises several benefits, such as increased performance or the reuse of legacy code, it can also break the language’s guarantees, e.g., crash safety.In this work, we first provide a comparative analysis of the security risks of native extension APIs in three popular scripting languages. Additionally, we discuss a novel methodology for studying the misuse of the native extension API. We then perform an in-depth study of npm, an ecosystem that is most exposed to threats introduced by native extensions. We show that vulnerabilities in extensions can be exploited in their embedding library by producing reads of uninitialized memory, hard crashes, or memory leaks in 33 npm packages simply by invoking their API with well-crafted inputs.

Commercial CI/CD platforms provide services for specifying and running CI/CD actions. However, they present a security risk in their own right, given their privileged access to secrets, infrastructure, and ability to fetch and execute arbitrary code.In this paper, we study the security of the newly popular GitHub CI platform. We first identify four fundamental security properties that must hold for any CI/CD system: Admittance Control, Execution Control, Code Control, and Access to Secrets. We then examine if GitHub CI enforces these properties in comparison with the other five popular CI/CD platforms. We perform a comprehensive analysis of 447,238 workflows spanning 213,854 GitHub repositories. We made several disturbing observations. Our analysis shows that 99.8% of workflows are overprivileged and have read-write access (instead of read-only) to the repository. In addition, 23.7% of workflows are triggerable by a pull_request and use code from the underlying repository. An attacker can exploit these workflows and execute arbitrary code as part of the workflow. Due to the modular nature of workflows, we find that 99.7% of repositories in our dataset execute some externally developed plugin, called ""Actions"" , for various purposes. We found that 97% of repositories execute at least one Action that does not originate with a verified creator, and 18% of repositories in our dataset execute at least one Action with missing security updates. These represent potential attack vectors that can be used to compromise the execution of workflows, consequently leading to supply chain attacks.

They enable the decentralized implementation of many interesting applications, such as financial protocols, voting systems, and supply-chain management. In many cases, multiple smart contracts need to work together and communicate with one another to implement complex business logic. However, these smart contracts must take special care to guard against malicious interactions that might lead to the violation of a contract's security properties and possibly result in substantial financial losses.In this paper, we introduce a class of inter-program communication flaws that we call confused contract vulnerabilities. This type of bug is an instance of the confused deputy vulnerability, set in the new context of smart contract inter-communication. When exploiting a confused contract bug, an attacker is able to divert a remote (inter-contract) call in a confused (victim) contract to a target contract and function of the attacker's choosing. The call performs sensitive operations on behalf of the confused contract, which can result in financial loss or malicious modifications of the persistent storage of the involved contracts.To identify opportunities for confused contract attacks at scale, we implemented Jackal, a system that is able to automatically identify and exploit confused contracts and candidate target contracts on the Ethereum mainnet.We leveraged Jackal to analyze a total of 2,335,193 smart contracts deployed in the past two years, and we identified 529 potential confused contracts for which we were able to generate 31 working exploits.

versarial manipulation, obtaining enough ground truth labeled
data for model training, and designing a system that can scale
to all active accounts on an OSN (potentially in the billions).
To address these challenges we present Deep Entity Classifi-
cation (DEC), an ML framework that detects abusive accounts
in OSNs that have evaded other, traditional abuse detection
systems. We leverage the insight that while accounts in isola-
tion may be difficult to classify, their embeddings in the social
graph—the network structure, properties, and behaviors of
themselves and those around them—are fundamentally dif-
ficult for attackers to replicate or manipulate at scale. Our
system:
• Extracts “deep features” of accounts by aggregating prop-
erties and behavioral features from their direct and indirect
neighbors in the social graph.
• Employs a “multi-stage multi-task learning” (MS-MTL)
paradigm that leverages imprecise ground truth data by
consuming, in separate stages, both a small number of high-
precision human-labeled samples and a large amount of
lower-precision automated labels. This architecture results
in a single model that provides high-precision classification
for multiple types of abusive accounts.
• Scales to billions of users through various sampling and
reclassification strategies that reduce system load.
DEC has been deployed at Facebook, where it classifies all
users continuously, resulting in an estimated reduction of

Such dominance comes from the unique representations of trigger-carrying images, which are assumed to be significantly different from what benign images produce. Our research, however, shows that this assumption can be broken by a targeted contamination TaCT that obscures the difference between those two kinds of representations and causes the attack images to be less distinguishable from benign ones, thereby evading existing protection.In our research, we observe that TaCT can affect the representation distribution of the target class but can hardly change the distribution across all classes, allowing us to build new defense performing a statistic analysis on the global information. More specifically, we leverage an EM algorithm to decompose an images into its identity part (e.g., person) and variation part (e.g., poses). Then the distribution of the variation, based upon the global information across all classes, is utilized by a likelihood-ratio test to analyze the representations in each class, identifying those more likely to be characterized by a mixture model resulted from adding attack samples into the legitimate image pool of the current class. Our research illustrates that our approach can effectively detect data contamination attacks, not only the known ones but the new TaCT attack discovered in our study.",227,https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity21/presentation/tang-di,"""supply chain"" source:""USENIX Security Symposium""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Detecting kernel memory bugs through inconsistent memory management intention inferences,"['D Liu', 'Z Lu', 'S Ji', 'K Lu', 'J Chen', 'Z Liu', 'D Liu']",2024,… Security Symposium  …,An empirical study on using large language models to analyze software supply chain  security failures. In Proceedings of the 2023 Workshop on Software Supply Chain Offensive,"Modern operating system kernels, typically written in low-level languages such as C and C++, are tasked with managing extensive memory resources. Memory-related errors, such as memory leak and memory corruption, are common occurrences and constantly introduced. Traditional detection methods often rely on taint analysis, which suffers from scalability issue (i.e., path explosion) when applied to complex OS kernels. Recent research has pivoted towards leveraging techniques like function pairing or similarity analysis to overcome this challenge. These approaches identify memory errors by referencing code that is either frequently used or semantically similar. However, these techniques have limitations when applied to customized code, which may lack a sufficient corpus of code snippets to facilitate effective function pairing or similarity analysis. This deficiency hinders their applicability in kernel analysis where unique or proprietary code is prevalent.In this paper, we propose a novel methodology for detecting memory bugs based on inconsistent memory management intentions (IMMI). Our insight is that many memory bugs, despite their varied manifestations, stem from a common underlying issue: the ambiguity in ownership and lifecycle management of memory objects, especially when these objects are passed across various functions. Memory bugs emerge when the mem- ory management strategies of the caller and callee functions misalign for a given memory object. IMMI aims to model and clarify these inconsistent intentions, thereby mitigating the prevalence of such bugs. Our methodology offers two primary advantages over existing techniques: (1) It utilizes a fine-grained memory management model that obviates the need for extensive data-flow tracking, and (2) it does not rely on similarity analysis or the identification of function pairs, making it highly effective in the context of customized code. To enhance the capabilities of IMMI, we have integrated a large language model (LLM) to assist in the interpretation of implicit kernel resource management mechanisms. We have implemented IMMI and evaluated it against the Linux kernel. IMMI effectively found 80 new memory bugs (including 23 memory corruptions and 57 memory leaks) with 35% false positive rate. Most of them are missed by the state-of-the-art memory bug detection tools.",0,https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity24/presentation/liu-dinghao-detecting,"""supply chain"" source:""USENIX Security Symposium""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CoRR,  abs/1708.06733, 2017. [27] Gaël Guennebaud, Benoît Jacob, et al.","With the increasing adoption of deep learning (DL) in various applications, developers often reuse models by, for example, performing model conversion among frameworks to raise productivity. However, security bugs in model conversion may make models behave differently across DL frameworks, and cause unpredictable errors. Prior studies primarily focus on the security of individual DL frameworks, but few of them can cope with the inconsistencies and security bugs during cross-framework conversion. Furthermore, the impact of these issues on DL applications remains largely unexplored. To this end, we propose TENSORSCOPE, a novel approach to test cross-framework APIs for security bugs. It takes as input a number of counterpart APIs that are supposed to be equivalent in functionality, then performs differential testing to identify the inconsistencies. We design novel strategies to boost testing efficiency, including 1) joint constraint analysis to raise the quality of test cases, and 2) error-guided test case fixing to refine the constraints for input. TENSORSCOPE is extensively evaluated on 1,658 APIs of six popular DL frameworks. The results show that TENSORSCOPE is more effective than FreeFuzz and DocTer by raising 28.7% and 24.3% code coverage, respectively. We find 257 bugs including 230 new bugs, and receive 8 CVEs and $1,100+ bounty with developers' acknowledgment. Most importantly, we make the first attempt to exploit these inconsistencies to make the accuracy of three models reduced by at most 3.5%.",11,https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity23/presentation/deng-zizhuang,"""supply chain"" source:""USENIX Security Symposium""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The latest and hitherto unbroken logic-locking techniques are based on the “corrupt-and-correct (CAC)” principle, offering provable security against input-output query attacks. However, it remains unclear whether these techniques are susceptible to structural attacks. This paper exploits the properties of integrated circuit (IC) design tools, also termed electronic design automation (EDA) tools, to undermine the security of the CAC techniques. Our proposed attack can break all the CAC techniques, including the unbroken CACrem technique that 40+ hackers taking part in a competition for more than three months could not break. Our attack can break circuits processed with any EDA tools, which is alarming because, until now, none of the EDA tools can render a secure locking solution: logic locking cannot make use of the existing EDA tools. We also provide a security property to ensure resilience against structural attacks. The commonly-used circuits can satisfy this property but only in a few cases where they cannot even defeat brute-force; thus, questions arise on the use of these circuits as benchmarks to evaluate logic locking and other security techniques.",36,https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity21/presentation/han-zhaokun,"""supply chain"" source:""USENIX Security Symposium""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, these systems lack solutions for efficient multithreaded safety and neglect kernel semantics that can be abused to bypass the monitor.The Endokernel is an intra-process security monitor that isolates memory at subprocess granularity. It ensures backwards-compatible and secure emulation of system interfaces, a task uniquely challenging due to the need to analyze OS and hardware semantics beyond mere interface usability. We introduce an inside-out methodology where we identify core OS primitives that allow bypass and map that back to the interfaces that depend on them. This approach led to the identification of several missing policies as well as aided in developing a fine-grained locking approach to deal with complex thread safety when inserting a monitor between the OS and the application. Results indicate that we can achieve fast isolation while greatly enhancing security and maintaining backwards-compatibility, and also showing a new method for systematically finding gaps in policies.",1,https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity24/presentation/yang-fangfei,"""supply chain"" source:""USENIX Security Symposium""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Model owners may be concerned that valuable intellectual property can be leaked if adversaries mount model extraction attacks. As it is difficult to defend against model extraction without sacrificing significant prediction accuracy, watermarking instead leveragesunused model capacityto have the model overfit to outlier input-output pairs. Such pairs are watermarks, which are not sampled from the task distribution and are only known to the defender. The defender then demonstrates knowledge of the input-output pairs to claim ownership of the model at inference. The effectiveness of watermarks remains limited because they are distinct from the task distribution and can thus be easily removed through compression or other forms of knowledge transfer.We introduceEntangled Watermarking Embeddings (EWE). Our approach encourages the model to learn features for classifying data that is sampled from thetask distribution and data that encodes watermarks. An adversary attempting to remove watermarks that are entangled with legitimate data is alsoforced to sacrifice performanceon legitimate data. Experiments on MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10, and Speech Commands validate that the defender can claim model ownership with 95% confidence with less than 100 queries to the stolen copy, at a modest cost below 0.81 percentage points on average in the defended model's performance.",290,https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity21/presentation/jia,"""supply chain"" source:""USENIX Security Symposium""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In light of this, several regulatory bodies have called for a need to audit smart contracts for security and correctness guarantees. Unfortunately, auditing smart contracts that do not have readily available source code can be challenging, and there are currently few tools available that aid in this process. Such contracts remain opaque to auditors. To address this, we present Erays, a reverse engineering tool for smart contracts. Erays takes in smart contract from the Ethereum blockchain, and produces high-level pseudocode suitable for manual analysis. We show how Erays can be used to provide insight into several contract properties, such as code complexity and code reuse in the ecosystem. We then leverage Erays to link contracts with no previously available source code to public source code, thus reducing the overall opacity in the ecosystem. Finally, we demonstrate how Erays can be used for reverse-engineering in four case studies: high-value multi-signature wallets, arbitrage bots, exchange accounts, and finally, a popular smart-contract game, Cryptokitties.

Despite the plethora of prior work on DNNs for continuous data (e.g., images), the vulnerability of graph neural networks (GNNs) for discrete-structured data (e.g., graphs) is largely unexplored, which is highly concerning given their increasing use in security-sensitive domains.To bridge this gap, we present GTA, the first backdoor attack on GNNs. Compared with prior work, GTA departs in significant ways: graph-oriented—it defines triggers as specific subgraphs, including both topological structures and descriptive features, entailing a large design spectrum for the adversary; input-tailored—it dynamically adapts triggers to individual graphs, thereby optimizing both attack effectiveness and evasiveness; downstream model-agnostic—it can be readily launched without knowledge regarding downstream models or fine-tuning strategies; and attack-extensible—it can be instantiated for both transductive (e.g., node classification) and inductive (e.g., graph classification) tasks, constituting severe threats for a range of security-critical applications. Through extensive evaluation using benchmark datasets and state-of-the-art models, we demonstrate the effectiveness of GTA.

They often choose control flow graph (CFG) as an important feature to learn out of functions, as CFGs characterize the control dependencies between basic code blocks. However, the exact role of CFGs in model decisions is not explored, and the extent to which CFGs might lead to model errors is unknown. This work takes a first step towards assessing the role of CFGs in ML-BFSD solutions both theoretically and practically, and promotes their performance accordingly. First, we adapt existing explanation methods to interpreting ML-BFSD solutions, and theoretically reveal that existing models heavily rely on CFG features. Then, we design a solution deltaCFG to manipulate CFGs and practically demonstrate the lack of robustness of existing models. We have extensively evaluated deltaCFG on 11 state-of-the-art (SOTA) ML-BFSD solutions, and find that the models' results would flip if we manipulate the query functions' CFGs but keep semantics, showing that most models have bias on CFG features. Our theoretic and practical assessment solutions can also serve as a robustness validator for the development of future ML-BFSD solutions. Lastly, we present a solution to utilize deltaCFG to augment training data, which helps deprioritize CFG features and enhance the performance of existing ML-BFSD solutions. Evaluation results show that, MRR, Recall@1, AUC and F1 score of existing models are improved by up to 10.1%, 12.7%, 5.1%, and 27.2% respectively, proving that reducing the models' bias on CFG features could improve their performance.",1,https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity24/presentation/wang-jialai,"""supply chain"" source:""USENIX Security Symposium""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This makes general purpose logic security critical since tampering with it could violate software-based security policies. Leveraging this insight, we develop a novel class of hardware trojans, which we dub Jinn trojans, that corrupt general-purpose hardware to enable flexible and powerful high level attacks. Jinn trojans deactivate compiler-based security-enforcement mechanisms, making type-safe software vulnerable to memory-safety attacks. We prototyped design-time Jinn trojans in the gem5 simulator and used them to attack programs written in Rust, inducing memory-safety vulnerabilities to launch control-flow hijacking attacks. We find that Jinn trojans can effectively compromise software-enforced security policies by compromising a single bit of architectural state with as little as 8 bits of persistent trojan-internal state. Thus, we show that Jinn trojans are effective even when planted in general purpose hardware, disjoint from any hardware-enforced security components.

Considering that the typical application scenario of VFL is that a few participants (usually two) collaboratively train a machine learning (ML) model with features distributed among them but labels owned by only one of them, protecting the privacy of the labels owned by one participant should be a fundamental guarantee provided by VFL, as the labels might be highly sensitive, e.g., whether a person has a certain kind of disease.

In this work, we propose Mudjacking, the first method to patch foundation models to remove backdoors. Specifically, given a misclassified trigger-embedded input detected after a backdoored foundation model is deployed, Mudjacking adjusts the parameters of the foundation model to remove the backdoor. We formulate patching a foundation model as an optimization problem and propose a gradient descent based method to solve it. We evaluate Mudjacking on both vision and language foundation models, eleven benchmark datasets, five existing backdoor attacks, and thirteen adaptive backdoor attacks.

However, secure training of large-scale ML models currently requires a prohibitively long time to complete. Given that large ML inference and training tasks in the plaintext setting are significantly accelerated by Graphical Processing Units (GPUs), this raises the natural question: can secure MPC leverage GPU acceleration? A few recent works have studied this question in the context of accelerating specific components or protocols, but do not provide a general-purpose solution. Consequently, MPC developers must be both experts in cryptographic protocol design and proficient at low-level GPU kernel development to achieve good performance on any new protocol implementation.We present Piranha, a general-purpose, modular platform for accelerating secret sharing-based MPC protocols using GPUs. Piranha allows the MPC community to easily leverage the benefits of a GPU without requiring GPU expertise. Piranha contributes a three-layer architecture: (1) a device layer that can independently accelerate secret-sharing protocols by providing integer-based kernels absent in current general-purpose GPU libraries, (2) a modular protocol layer that allows developers to maximize utility of limited GPU memory with in-place computation and iterator-based support for non-standard memory access patterns, and (3) an application layer that allows applications to remain completely agnostic to the underlying protocols they use.To demonstrate the benefits of Piranha, we implement 3 state-of-the-art linear secret sharing MPC protocols for secure NN training: 2-party SecureML (IEEE S&P '17), 3-party Falcon (PETS '21), and 4-party FantasticFour (USENIX Security '21). Compared to their CPU-based implementations, the same protocols implemented on top of Piranha's protocol-agnostic acceleration exhibit a 16-48x decrease in training time.

Various LDP protocols have been developed for different types of data such as categorical data, numerical data, and key-value data. Due to their distributed settings, LDP protocols are fundamentally vulnerable to poisoning attacks, in which fake users manipulate the server's analytics results via sending carefully crafted data to the server. However, existing poisoning attacks focused on LDP protocols for simple data types such as categorical and numerical data, leaving the security of LDP protocols for more advanced data types such as key-value data unexplored.In this work, we aim to bridge the gap by introducing novel poisoning attacks to LDP protocols for key-value data. In such a LDP protocol, a server aims to simultaneously estimate the frequency and mean value of each key among some users, each of whom possesses a set of key-value pairs. Our poisoning attacks aim to simultaneously maximize the frequencies and mean values of some attacker-chosen target keys via sending carefully crafted data from some fake users to the sever. Specifically, since our attacks have two objectives, we formulate them as a two-objective optimization problem. Moreover, we propose a method to approximately solve the two-objective optimization problem, from which we obtain the optimal crafted data the fake users should send to the server. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our attacks to three LDP protocols for key-value data both theoretically and empirically. We also explore two defenses against our attacks, which are effective in some scenarios but have limited effectiveness in other scenarios.

We propose four categories of side channels that span the entire ML lifecycle (training data filtering, input preprocessing, output post-processing, and query filtering) and allow for enhanced membership inference, data extraction, and even novel threats such as extraction of users' test queries. For example, we show that deduplicating training data before applying differentially-private training creates a side-channel that completely invalidates any provable privacy guarantees. We further show that systems which block language models from regenerating training data can be exploited to exfiltrate private keys contained in the training set—even if the model did not memorize these keys.

Creating a high-quality prompt that consists of a subject and several modifiers can be time-consuming and costly. In consequence, a trend of trading high-quality prompts on specialized marketplaces has emerged. In this paper, we perform the first study on understanding the threat of a novel attack, namely prompt stealing attack, which aims to steal prompts from generated images by text-to-image generation models. Successful prompt stealing attacks directly violate the intellectual property of prompt engineers and jeopardize the business model of prompt marketplaces. We first perform a systematic analysis on a dataset collected by ourselves and show that a successful prompt stealing attack should consider a prompt's subject as well as its modifiers. Based on this observation, we propose a simple yet effective prompt stealing attack, PromptStealer. It consists of two modules: a subject generator trained to infer the subject and a modifier detector for identifying the modifiers within the generated image. Experimental results demonstrate that PromptStealer is superior over three baseline methods, both quantitatively and qualitatively. We also make some initial attempts to defend PromptStealer. In general, our study uncovers a new attack vector within the ecosystem established by the popular text-to-image generation models.

Leveraging LiveBugger, we perform a comprehensive empirical assessment of representative FLV platforms, leading to a set of interesting findings.

Based on these findings, we propose a customized, two-stage approach that can boost the attack success rate by up to 70%. Further, we run proof-of-concept attacks on several representative applications of FLV (i.e., the clients of FLV APIs) to illustrate the practical implications: due to the vulnerability of the APIs, many downstream applications are vulnerable to deepfake.

Thus, vendors must rapidly fix such vulnerabilities and revoke vulnerable versions to prevent rollback attacks, i.e., loading an old version of the TA to exploit a known vulnerability.In this paper, we assess the state of TA rollback prevention by conducting a large-scale cross-vendor study. First, we establish the largest TA dataset in existence, encompassing 35,541 TAs obtained from 1,330 firmware images deployed on mobile devices across the top five most common vendors. Second, we identify 37 TA vulnerabilities that we leverage to assess the state of industry-wide TA rollback effectiveness. Third, we make the counterintuitive discovery that the uncoordinated usage of rollback prevention correlates with the leakage of security-critical information and has far-reaching consequences potentially negatively impacting the whole mobile ecosystem.

The attack allows a third party, without knowledge of any secret material (such as link and encryption keys), to make two (or more) victims agree on an encryption key with only 1 byte (8 bits) of entropy. Such low entropy enables the attacker to easily brute force the negotiated encryption keys, decrypt the eavesdropped ciphertext, and inject valid encrypted messages (in real-time). The attack is stealthy because the encryption key negotiation is transparent to the Bluetooth users. The attack is standard-compliant because all Bluetooth BR/EDR versions require to support encryption keys with entropy between 1 and 16 bytes and do not secure the key negotiation protocol. As a result,the attacker completely breaks Bluetooth BR/EDR security without being detected.We call our attackKey Negotiation Of Bluetooth (KNOB)attack.The attack targets the firmware of the Bluetooth chip because the firmware (Bluetooth controller) implements all the security features of Bluetooth BR/EDR. As a standard-compliant attack, it is expected to be effective on any firmware that follows the specification and on any device using a vulnerable firmware. We describe how to perform the KNOB attack, and we implement it. We evaluate our implementation on more than 14 Bluetooth chips from popular manufacturers such as Intel, Broadcom, Apple, and Qualcomm.

By injecting on behalf of trusted victim devices we can circumvent any software-based authorisation policy defences that computer systems employ against common USB attacks.

Unlike data poisoning attacks that target the training stage of a DNN model, a run-time attack executes an exploit such as Rowhammer on memory to flip the bits of the target model and thereby implant a Trojan. This threat is stealthier but more challenging, as it requires flipping a set of bits in the target model to introduce an effective Trojan without noticeably downgrading the model's accuracy. This has been achieved only under the less realistic assumption that the target model is fully shared with the adversary through memory, thus enabling them to flip bits across all model layers, including the last few layers.For the first time, we have investigated run-time Trojan Injection under a more realistic gray-box scenario. In this scenario, a model is perceived in an encoder-decoder manner: the encoder is public and shared through memory, while the decoder is private and so considered to be black-box and inaccessible to unauthorized parties. To address the unique challenge posed by the black-box decoder to Trojan injection in this scenario, we developed a suite of innovative techniques. Using these techniques, we constructed our gray-box attack, Groan, which stands out as both effective and stealthy. Our experiments show that Groan is capable of injecting a highly effective Trojan into the target model, while also largely preserving its performance, even in the presence of state-of-theart memory protection.",0,https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity24/presentation/wang-zihao-tossing,"""supply chain"" source:""USENIX Security Symposium""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

First, we uncover a post-hoc workflow underlying most prior work, where defenders passively allow the attack to proceed and then leverage the characteristics of the post-attacked model to uncover poison samples. We reveal that this workflow does not fully exploit defenders' capabilities, and defense pipelines built on it are prone to failure or performance degradation in many scenarios. Second, we suggest a paradigm shift by promoting a proactive mindset in which defenders engage proactively with the entire model training and poison detection pipeline, directly enforcing and magnifying distinctive characteristics of the post-attacked model to facilitate poison detection. Based on this, we formulate a unified framework and provide practical insights on designing detection pipelines that are more robust and generalizable. Third, we introduce the technique of Confusion Training (CT) as a concrete instantiation of our framework. CT applies an additional poisoning attack to the already poisoned dataset, actively decoupling benign correlation while exposing backdoor patterns to detection.

A recent study shows that a malicious library could harvest data from other libraries hosted in the same app via unauthorized API accesses. However, it is unclear whether third-party libraries could still pose a threat to other libraries after their code and APIs are thoroughly vetted for security.A third-party Android library often contains diverse resources to support its operations. These resources, along with resources from other libraries, are managed by the Android resource compiler (ARC) during the app build process. ARC needs to mediate the resources in case multiple libraries have duplicate resources.In this paper, we report a new attack surface on the Android app supply chain: duplicate resource mismediation (Duress). This attack surface provides an opportunity for attackers to contaminate security- and privacy-sensitive resources of a victim library by exploiting ARC, using duplicate resources in malicious libraries.

This opens several vectors for covertly launching attacks against deployed models. To detect these attacks, prior work developed black-box and white-box testing methods. However, this has left prohibitive open challenge: how the investigator is supposed to recover the model (uniquely refined on an in-the-field device) for testing in the first place. We propose a novel memory forensic technique, named AiP, which automatically recovers the unique deployment model and rehosts it in a lab environment for investigation. AiP navigates through both main memory and GPU memory spaces to recover complex ML data structures, using recovered Python objects to guide the recovery of lower-level C objects, ultimately leading to the recovery of the uniquely refined model. AiP then rehosts the model within the investigator's device, where the investigator can apply various white-box testing methodologies. We have evaluated AiP using three versions of TensorFlow and PyTorch with the CIFAR-10, LISA, and IMDB datasets. AiP recovered 30 models from main memory and GPU memory with 100% accuracy and rehosted them into a live process successfully.",1,https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity24/presentation/oygenblik,"""supply-chain"" source:""USENIX Security Symposium""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We obtained expert S&P ratings of IoT devices from a European consumer association and the corresponding sales data from a leading Dutch online store. We complemented this with additional information like user ratings, the number of reviews and update support duration from two Dutch online stores. Our regression model shows that, holding other variables constant, a one-standard-deviation increase in S&P ratings corresponds to a noteworthy 56% boost in sales. Crucially, we observe a possible correlation between price and demand for S&P at lower prices, the sales of IoT devices are directly proportional to the S&P rating, but this relationship diminishes as price increases. Further, we find that the presence of update support duration information, intended as a security signal, corresponds to higher S&P ratings and, all else being constant, also corresponds to a 69% increase in sales. While the exact causal mechanisms for the boost in sales remain unclear, our findings suggest positive incentives might be at play for IoT devices offering S&P at affordable prices and presenting relevant S&P information at the point of purchase.",0,https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity24/presentation/vetrivel,"""supply-chain"" source:""USENIX Security Symposium""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Attackers can project specifically crafted adversarial perturbations onto real-world objects, transforming them into AE. This grants adversaries greater control over the attack compared to adversarial patches, as projections can be turned on and off as needed and leave no obvious trace of an attack.We study the feasibility of SLAP in the self-driving scenario, targeting both object detector and traffic sign recognition tasks, focusing on the detection of stop signs. We conduct experiments in a variety of ambient light conditions, including outdoors, showing how in non-bright settings the proposed method generates AE that are extremely robust, causing misclassifications on state-of-the-art neural networks with up to 99% success rate. Our experiments show that SLAP-generated AE do not present detectable behaviours seen in adversarial patches and therefore bypass SentiNet, a physical AE detection method.

Integrated with deep neural networks, it becomes deep reinforcement learning, a new paradigm of learning methods. Recently, deep reinforcement learning demonstrates great potential in many applications such as playing video games, mastering GO competition, and even performing autonomous pilot. However, coming together with these great successes is adversarial attacks, in which an adversary could force a well-trained agent to behave abnormally by tampering the input to the agent's policy network or training an adversarial agent to exploit the weakness of the victim.In this work, we show existing adversarial attacks against reinforcement learning either work in an impractical setting or perform less effectively when being launched in a two-agent zero-sum game. Motivated by this, we propose a new method to train adversarial agents. Technically speaking, our approach extends the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm and then utilizes an explainable AI technique to guide an attacker to train an adversarial agent. In comparison with the adversarial agent trained by the state-of-the-art technique, we show that our adversarial agent exhibits a much stronger capability in exploiting the weakness of victim agents. Besides, we demonstrate that our adversarial attack introduces less variation in the training process and exhibits less sensitivity to the selection of initial states.",61,https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity21/presentation/wu-xian,"""supply-chain"" source:""USENIX Security Symposium""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To reduce computational costs, pre-trained neural networks often employ subsampling operations. However, recent studies have shown that these subsampling operations can cause aliasing issues, resulting in problems with generalization. Despite this knowledge, there is still a lack of research on the relationship between the aliasing of neural networks and security threats, such as adversarial attacks and backdoor attacks, which manipulate model predictions without the awareness of victims. In this paper, we propose the aliasing backdoor, a low-cost and data-free attack that threatens mainstream pre-trained models and transfers to all student models fine-tuned from them. The key idea is to create an aliasing error in the strided layers of the network and manipulate a benign input to a targeted intermediate representation. To evaluate the attack, we conduct experiments on image classification, face recognition, and speech recognition tasks. The results show that our approach can effectively attack mainstream models with a success rate of over 95%. Our research, based on the aliasing error caused by subsampling, reveals a fundamental security weakness of strided layers, which are widely used in modern neural network architectures. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to exploit the strided layers to launch backdoor attacks.",4,https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity23/presentation/wei-chengan,"""supply-chain"" source:""USENIX Security Symposium""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Both attacks attempt to hijack the model behaviors with unintended outputs by introducing (small) perturbations to the inputs. However, neither attack is without limitations in practice. Backdoor attacks, despite the high success rates, often require the strong assumption that the adversary could tamper with the training data or code of the target model, which is not always easy to achieve in reality. Adversarial example attacks, which put relatively weaker assumptions on attackers, often demand high computational resources, yet do not always yield satisfactory success rates when attacking mainstream blackbox models in the real world. These limitations motivate the following research question: can model hijacking be achieved in a simpler way with more satisfactory attack performance and also more reasonable attack assumptions?In this paper, we provide a positive answer with CleanSheet, a new model hijacking attack that obtains the high performance of backdoor attacks without requiring the adversary to temper with the model training process. CleanSheet exploits vulnerabilities in DNNs stemming from the training data. Specifically, our key idea is to treat part of the clean training data of the target model as ""poisoned data"", and capture the characteristics of these data that are more sensitive to the model (typically called robust features) to construct ""triggers"". These triggers can be added to any input example to mislead the target model, similar to backdoor attacks. We validate the effectiveness of CleanSheet through extensive experiments on five datasets, 79 normally trained models, 68 pruned models, and 39 defensive models. Results show that CleanSheet exhibits performance comparable to state-of-theart backdoor attacks, achieving an average attack success rate (ASR) of 97.5% on CIFAR-100 and 92.4% on GTSRB, respectively. Furthermore, CleanSheet consistently maintains a high ASR, with most ASR surpassing 80%, when confronted with various mainstream backdoor defense mechanisms.",1,https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity24/presentation/ge-hijacking,"""supply-chain"" source:""USENIX Security Symposium""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using our matching technique, we objectively quantify the effect that continued exposure to spam has on user engagement in Yahoo! Mail. We find that indeed spam exposure leads to significantly, both statistically and economically, lower user engagement. The impact is non-linear; large changes impact users in a progressively more negative fashion.

We further investigate, by simulation, the impact of scraping frequency, consistency and rate-limits. We find that, even with a decent scraping regimen, one might miss approximately 46% of objects—with scraped listings differing significantly from not-scraped listings on price, views and product categories. This bias also impacts revenue calculations. We find Hansa's total market revenue to be US $50M, which projections based on our scrapes underestimate by a factor of four. Simulations further show that studies based on one or two scrapes are likely to suffer from a very poor coverage (on average, 14% to 30%, respectively).A high scraping frequency is crucial to achieve reliable coverage, even without a consistent scraping routine. When high-frequency scraping is difficult, e.g., due to deployed anti-scraping countermeasures, innovative scraper design, such as scraping most popular listings first, helps improve coverage.

However, thus far it remains under-explored how contrastive backdoor attacks fundamentally differ from their supervised counterparts, which impedes the development of effective defenses against the emerging threat.This work represents a solid step toward answering this critical question. Specifically, we define TRL, a unified framework that encompasses both supervised and contrastive backdoor attacks. Through the lens of TRL, we uncover that the two types of attacks operate through distinctive mechanisms: in supervised attacks, the learning of benign and backdoor tasks tends to occur independently, while in contrastive attacks, the two tasks are deeply intertwined both in their representations and throughout their learning processes. This distinction leads to the disparate learning dynamics and feature distributions of supervised and contrastive attacks. More importantly, we reveal that the specificities of contrastive backdoor attacks entail important implications from a defense perspective: existing defenses for supervised attacks are often inadequate and not easily retrofitted to contrastive attacks. We also explore several promising alternative defenses and discuss their potential challenges.

Further, with both empirical and analytical evidence, we provide possible explanations for such phenomena: given the prohibitive search space and training cost, most NAS methods favor models that converge fast at early training stages; this preference results in architectural properties associated with attack vulnerabilities (e.g., high loss smoothness, low gradient variance). Our findings not only reveal the relationships between model characteristics and attack vulnerabilities but also suggest the inherent connections underlying different attacks.

Vulnerable firmware remains a major factor in exploiting IoT devices. Persistent storage interfaces, which allow data retention even after power loss, can exacerbate this problem. This work examines and informs on the security impact of persistent storage through the lens of security-critical sanitization bypass flaws, computed attack surface spread, and the presence of command injection vulnerabilities; three facets of firmware code that can influence its susceptibility to exploitation. The assessment is established upon manually annotated call sequences that allow reasoning about path sanitization in order to formulate well-founded observations. We assemble a dataset of 100 IoT firmware images from four well-known vendors and initially find 68 devices whose persistent storage receives attacker-controllable input in over 4800 unique unsanitized paths. Furthermore, we discovered 77 instances of sanitization bypass flaws in 32 devices. In addition, we create the taint spread metric to assess the impact of tainted persistent storage on a firmware’s attack surface; in one alarming instance we find tainted data to affect over 1500 firmware code locations. Finally, we leverage the modeled call sequences to detect and exploit seven 0-day command injection vulnerabilities in five acquired devices and five assigned PSVs.",0,https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=ypkTEQAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PA395&dq=%22software+supply+chain%22+source:%22Detection+of+Intrusions+and+Malware%22&ots=p1b1Adgejs&sig=_I2T6u05vg-nCX5F81qPPIZkYNA,"""software supply chain"" source:""Detection of Intrusions and Malware""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recent,"A software supply chain attack is characterized by the injection of malicious code into a software package in order to compromise dependent systems further down the chain. Recent years saw a number of supply chain attacks that leverage the increasing use of open source during software development, which is facilitated by dependency managers that automatically resolve, download and install hundreds of open source packages throughout the software life cycle. This paper presents a dataset of 174 malicious software packages that were used in real-world attacks on open source software supply chains, and which were distributed via the popular package repositories npm, PyPI, and RubyGems. Those packages, dating from November 2015 to November 2019, were manually collected and analyzed. The paper also presents two general attack trees to provide a structured overview about techniques to inject malicious code into the dependency tree of downstream users, and to execute such code at different times and under different conditions. This work is meant to facilitate the future development of preventive and detective safeguards by open source and research communities.",309,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-52683-2_2,"""software supply chain"" source:""Detection of Intrusions and Malware""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thus, memory de-duplication can increase memory density by allocating memory for shared binaries only once. Existing de-duplication approaches, however, either rely on a shared OS to de-deduplicate binary objects, which provides unacceptably weak isolation; or exploit hypervisor-based de-duplication at the level of memory pages, which is blind to the semantics of the objects to be shared.

We describe Object Reuse with Capabilities (ORC), which supports the fine-grained sharing of binary objects between tenants, while isolating tenants strongly through a small trusted computing base (TCB). ORC uses hardware support for memory capabilities to isolate tenants, which permits shared objects to be accessible to multiple tenants safely. Since ORC shares binary objects within a single address space through capabilities, it uses a new relocation type to create per-tenant state when loading shared objects. ORC supports the loading of objects by an untrusted guest, outside of its TCB, only verifying the safety of the loaded data. Our experiments show that ORC achieves a higher memory density with a lower overhead than hypervisor-based de-deduplication.",6,https://www.usenix.org/conference/osdi23/presentation/sartakov,"""software supply chain"" source:""OSDI""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this work, we show how to use only commit logs and repository metadata to automatically detect anomalous and potentially malicious commits. We identify and evaluate several relevant factors which can be automatically computed from this data, such as the modification of sensitive files, outlier change properties, or a lack of trust in the commit's author. Our tool, Anomalicious, automatically computes these factors and considers them holistically using a rule-based decision model. In an evaluation on a data set of 15 malware-infected repositories, Anomalicious showed promising results and identified 53.33% of malicious commits, while flagging less than 1% of commits for most repositories. Additionally, the tool found other interesting anomalies that are not related to malicious commits in an analysis of repositories with no known malicious commits.",66,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9402087/,"""software supply chain"" source:""Software Engineering in Practice""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the United States, the White House Office released a memorandum on Executive Order (EO) 14028 that mandates organizations provide self-attestation of the use of secure software development practices. The OpenSSF Scorecard project allows practitioners to measure the use of software security practices automatically. However, little research has been done to determine whether the use of security practices improves package security, particularly which security practices have the biggest impact on security outcomes. The goal of this study is to assist practitioners and researchers making informed decisions on which security practices to adopt through the development of models between software security practice scores and security vulnerability counts.
To that end, we developed five supervised machine learning models for npm and PyPI packages using the OpenSSF Scorecared security practices scores and aggregate security scores as predictors and the number of externally-reported vulnerabilities as a target variable. Our models found four security practices (Maintained, Code Review, Branch Protection, and Security Policy) were the most important practices influencing vulnerability count. However, we had low R^2 (ranging from 9% to 12%) when we tested the models to predict vulnerability counts. Additionally, we observed that the number of reported vulnerabilities increased rather than reduced as the aggregate security score of the packages increased. Both findings indicate that additional factors may influence the package vulnerability count. We suggest that vulnerability count and security score data be refined such that these measures may be used to provide actionable guidance on security practices.",18,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10172593/,"""software supply chain"" source:""Software Engineering in Practice""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we present a systematic approach towards build verifiability on Java-based systems.

We apply our approach on 46 unverified open source projects from Reproducible Central and 13 open source projects that are widely used by Huawei commercial products. As a result, 91% of the unverified Reproducible Central projects and 100% of the commercially adopted OSS projects are successfully verified with our approach. In addition, based on our experience in analyzing thousands of builds for both commercial and open source Java-based systems, we present 14 patterns that introduce non-equivalences in generated build artifacts and their respective mitigation strategies. Among these patterns, 11 (78%) are unique for Java-based system, whereas the remaining 3 (22%) are common with C/C++-based systems.

One of the remedies to privacy breach incidents is to encapsulate computations over sensitive data within hardware-assisted Trusted Execution Environments (TEE). Such TEE-powered software is called secure enclaves. Secure enclaves hold various advantages against competing for privacy-preserving computation solutions. However, enclaves are much more challenging to build compared with ordinary software. The reason is that the development of TEE software must follow a restrictive programming model to make effective use of strong memory encryption and segregation enforced by hardware. These constraints transitively apply to all third-party dependencies of the software. If these dependencies do not officially support TEE hardware, TEE developers have to spend additional engineering effort in porting them. High development and maintenance cost is one of the major obstacles against adopting TEE-based privacy protection solutions in production.In this paper, we present our experience and achievements with regard to constructing and continuously maintaining a third-party library supply chain for TEE developers. In particular, we port a large collection of Rust third-party libraries into Intel SGX, one of the most mature trusted computing platforms. Our supply chain accepts upstream patches in a timely manner with SGX-specific security auditing. We have been able to maintain the SGX ports of 159 open-source Rust libraries with reasonable operational costs.

Proactive approaches are needed to predict package vulnerability to high-risk supply chain attacks. The goal of this work is to help software developers and security specialists in measuring npm supply chain weak link signals to prevent future supply chain attacks by empirically studying npm package metadata.

We design and implement RogueOne, a system for detecting rogue updates to JavaScript packages. RogueOne uses a novel differential data-flow analysis to capture how an update changes a package's interactions with external APIs. Using an efficient form of abstract interpretation that can exclude unchanged code in a package, it constructs an object data-flow relationship graph (ODRG) that tracks data-flows among objects. RogueOne then maps objects to trust domains, a novel abstraction which summarizes trust relationships in a package. Objects are assigned a trust domain based on whether they originate in the target package, a dependency, or in a system API. RogueOne uses the ODRG to build a set of data-flows across trust domains. It compares data-flow sets across package versions to detect untrustworthy new interactions with external APIs. We evaluated RogueOne on hundreds of npm packages, demonstrating its effectiveness at detecting rogue updates and distinguishing them from benign ones. RogueOne achieves high accuracy and can be more than seven times as effective in detecting rogue updates and avoiding false positives compared to other systems built to detect malicious packages.",2,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3597503.3639199,"""software supply chain"" source:""International Conference on Software Engineering""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Software composition analysis, proposed to identify reused TPLs for reducing such risks, has become an essential procedure within modern DevSecOps. As one of the mainstream SCA techniques, binary-to-source SCA identifies the third-party source projects contained in binary files via binary source code matching, which is a major challenge in reverse engineering since binary and source code exhibit substantial disparities after compilation. The existing binary-to-source SCA techniques leverage basic syntactic features that suffer from redundancy and lack robustness in the large-scale TPL dataset, leading to inevitable false positives and compromised recall. To mitigate these limitations, we introduce BinaryAI, a novel binary-to-source SCA technique with two-phase binary source code matching to capture both syntactic and semantic code features. First, BinaryAI trains a transformer-based model to produce function-level embeddings and obtain similar source functions for each binary function accordingly. Then by applying the link-time locality to facilitate function matching, BinaryAI detects the reused TPLs based on the ratio of matched source functions. Our experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of BinaryAI in terms of binary source code matching and the downstream SCA task. Specifically, our embedding model outperforms the state-of-the-art model CodeCMR, i.e., achieving 22.54% recall@1 and 0.34 MRR compared with 10.75% and 0.17 respectively. Additionally, BinaryAI outperforms all existing binary-to-source SCA tools in TPL detection, increasing the precision from 73.36% to 85.84% and recall from 59.81% to 64.98% compared with the well-recognized commercial SCA product.",18,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3597503.3639100,"""software supply chain"" source:""International Conference on Software Engineering""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

GitHub Actions is emerging as a popular platform for implementing CI/CD pipelines, called workflows, especially because the platform offers 2,000 minutes of computation for free to public repositories each month. To understand what these resources are used for and whether CI/CD could be more efficient, this paper presents the first comprehensive empirical study of resource usage and optimization opportunities of GitHub Action workflows. Our findings show that CI/CD imposes significant costs, e.g., $504 per year for an average paid-tier repository. The majority of the used resources is consumed by testing and building (91.2%), which is triggered by pull requests (50.7%), pushes (30.9%), and regularly scheduled workflows (15.5%). While existing optimizations, such as caching (adopted by 32.9% of paid-tier repositories), demonstrate a positive impact, they overall remain underutilized. This result underscores the need for enhanced documentation and tools to guide developers toward more resource-efficient workflows. Moreover, we show that relatively simple changes in the platform, such as deactivating scheduled workflows when repositories are inactive, could result in reductions of execution time between 1.1% and 31.6% over the impacted workflows.

In this paper, we present Cneps, a precise approach for examining dependencies in reused C/C++ OSS components. The key idea of Cneps is to use a novel granularity called a module, which represents a minimum unit (i.e., set of source files) that can be reused as a library from another project. By examining dependencies based on modules instead of analyzing single reused files, Cneps can precisely identify dependencies in the target projects, even in the presence of indistinguishable files. To differentiate duplicated components, Cneps examines the cloned paths and originating projects of each component, enabling precise identification of dependencies associated with them. Experimental results on top 100 C/C++ software show that Cneps outperforms a state-of-the-art approach by identifying twice as many dependencies.

However, current security patch analysis works yield relatively low recall rates (i.e., many security patches are missed). In this work, we offer a new solution to detect safe patches and assist downstream developers in patch propagation. Specifically, we develop SPatch to detect fine-grained safe patches. SPatch leverages fine-grained patch analysis and a new differential symbolic execution technique to analyze the functional impacts of code changes.
We evaluated SPatch on various software, including the Linux kernel and OpenSSL, and demonstrated that it outperformed existing methods in detecting safe patches, resulting in observable security benefits. In our case studies, we updated hundreds of functions in modern software using safe patches detected by SPatch without causing any regression issues. Our detected safe security patches have been merged into the latest version of downstream software like ProtonVPN.",1,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3597503.3639104,"""software supply chain"" source:""International Conference on Software Engineering""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Existing works usually assume that the query function and target function share equal,"Binary function similarity detection plays an important role in a wide range of security applications. Existing works usually assume that the query function and target function share equal semantics and compare their full semantics to obtain the similarity. However, we find that the function mapping is more complex, especially when function inlining happens.
In this paper, we will systematically investigate cross-inlining binary function similarity detection. We first construct a cross-inlining dataset by compiling 51 projects using 9 compilers, with 4 optimizations, to 6 architectures, with 2 inlining flags, which results in two datasets both with 216 combinations. Then we construct the cross-inlining function mappings by linking the common source functions in these two datasets. Through analysis of this dataset, we find that three cross-inlining patterns widely exist while existing work suffers when detecting cross-inlining binary function similarity. Next, we propose a pattern-based model named CI-Detector for cross-inlining matching. CI-Detector uses the attributed CFG to represent the semantics of binary functions and GNN to embed binary functions into vectors. CI-Detector respectively trains a model for these three cross-inlining patterns. Finally, the testing pairs are input to these three models and all the produced similarities are aggregated to produce the final similarity. We conduct several experiments to evaluate CI-Detector. Results show that CI-Detector can detect cross-inlining pairs with a precision of 81% and a recall of 97%, which exceeds all state-of-the-art works.",5,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3597503.3639080,"""software supply chain"" source:""International Conference on Software Engineering""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As the Python ecosystem grows, developers face increasing challenges in avoiding module conflicts, which occur when different packages have the same namespace modules. Unfortunately, existing work has neither investigated the module conflict comprehensively nor provided tools to detect the conflict. Therefore, this paper systematically investigates the module conflict problem and its impact on the Python ecosystem. We propose a novel technique called InstSimulator, which leverages semantics and installation simulation to achieve accurate and efficient module extraction. Based on this, we implement a tool called ModuleGuard to detect module conflicts for the Python ecosystem. For the study, we first collect 97 MC issues, classify the characteristics and causes of these MC issues, summarize three different conflict patterns, and analyze their potential threats. Then, we conducted a large-scale analysis of the whole PyPI ecosystem (4.2 million packages) and GitHub popular projects (3,711 projects) to detect each MC pattern and analyze their potential impact. We discovered that module conflicts still impact numerous TPLs and GitHub projects. This is primarily due to developers' lack of understanding of the modules within their direct dependencies, not to mention the modules of the transitive dependencies. Our work reveals Python's shortcomings in handling naming conflicts and provides a tool and guidelines for developers to detect conflicts.",3,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3597503.3639221,"""software supply chain"" source:""International Conference on Software Engineering""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While the assembly of increasingly complex components in modern software development resembles a supply chain, classical supply chain management concepts are rarely applied. An interruption in the flow of information exists between the development/maintenance phases and operational phases, resulting in ignorance, inefficiencies, and suboptimal quality and support levels. One reason for this is the effort necessary to integrate the software lifecycle processes, coupled with the dispersion of information needed for execution of (semi-)automated software lifecycle workflows across semantically heterogeneous sources. Furthermore, the manual derivation of abstract IT (e.g., ITIL) and software processes into concrete processes and workflows results in low quality and inefficiencies.

We segment our analysis to allow for a direct analysis of security-relevant updates (those that introduce or patch vulnerabilities) in comparison to the rest of the ecosystem. We find that when developers use semver correctly, critical updates such as security patches can flow quite rapidly to downstream dependencies in the majority of cases (90.09%), but this does not always occur, due to developers' imperfect use of both semver version constraints and semver version number increments.
